# ARQMath Clef 2020
This code provide a simple data reader for [ARQMath](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~dprl/ARQMath/) lab at [CLEF 2020](https://clef2020.clef-initiative.eu/). 

## Getting Started

To begin the code, first download and locate the MSE ARQMath Dataset. Then you can simply use ```post_reader.py``` to read the data using a ```DataReader```. Each file in the dataset, is related to at least one entity. For instance, the '''user.xml''' file, contains the information for '''user''' entitiy. Therefore, the ```DataReader``` has different parser for each of the files and links all the related information.
