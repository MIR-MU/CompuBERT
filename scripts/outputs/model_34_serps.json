We'll prove this by answering  b) , constructing a Harshad number with digit sum $n$.   First, we define  l(n)  to be  n  without its factors  2  and  5 . Examples are:  l(23)=23 ,  l(24)=3 ,  l(25)=1 . If we ca n  construct a number with digit sum $n$ that is divisible by  l(n) , the n  surely we can make it divisible by $n$ by just adding enough  0 's at the end (equivalent to multiplying it with  10  repeatedly, so this wont change the fact that it is divisible by  l(n) ). Let  A  be a set of  n  non-negative integers, that is,  A\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}_0  and  |A|=n . Now the number    \\xi=\\sum_{a\\in A}10^a    has digit sum  n ,  a nd this doesn't depend on the numbers in $a$. For it to be divisible by  l(n) , we'd need    \\xi=\\sum_{a\\in A}10^a\\equiv 0\\mod l(n)    and since  10^{\\phi(l(n))}\\equiv1\\mod l(n)  (note that we use  \\gcd(10,l(n))=1  here), we can choose    A=\\{0\\cdot\\phi(l(n)),1\\cdot\\phi(l(n)),2\\cdot\\phi(l(n)),\\cdots,(n-1)\\cdot\\phi(l(n))\\}    so that we get (all equivalences are  \\mod l(n) ): \\begin{align} \\xi&\\equiv\\sum_{a\\in A}10^a\\\\ &\\equiv\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}10^{k\\cdot\\phi(l(n))}\\\\ &\\equiv\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\\left(10^{\\phi(l(n))}\\right)^{k}\\\\ &\\equiv\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}1^{k}\\\\ &\\equiv\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}1\\\\ &\\equiv n\\\\ &\\equiv 0\\mod l(n) \\end{align} where the last,  n\\equiv0\\mod l(n) , holds since  l(n)\\mid n , because  l(n)  has the same factors as  n  and maybe a little less, but never more. Now we can append enough zeroes at the end so that it is not only divisible by  l(n) , but also by  n . To get back to your example  n=11 , we get  l(11)=11 , and  \\phi(l(n))=\\phi(11)=10 , so we get  A=\\{0,10,20,30,\\cdots,100\\} , arriving at the number        10000000001000000000100000000010000000001000000000100000000010000000001000000000100000000010000000001      and we don't need to append zeroes because  11  didn't contain any factors  2  or  5 .

First o f  all it is obvious that i f  a function $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the standard definition (the one which involves choice of partition as well as tags) then it is also Riemann integrable according to the two alternative definitions suggested by OP.    Further we know that the theory of Riemann integration is conveniently studied using Darboux sums instead of Riemann sums and in this connection we have the following result (proof is available in almost any real-analysis textbook):        Criterion for Riemann Integrability :  A function $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  if and only if for every  \\epsilon > 0  there is a partition  P_{\\epsilon}  of  [a, b]  such that  U(f, P_{\\epsilon}) - L(f, P_{\\epsilon}) < \\epsilon  where for any partition  P = \\{a = x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n} = b\\}, x_{i - 1} < x_{i}, i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n  the upper Darboux sum  f or $f$ (denoted by  U(f, P) ) and lower Darboux sum (denoted by  L(f, P) ) is given by  U(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}),\\, L(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}m_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1})  with  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\},\\,m_{i} = \\inf\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}      Using this result it is possible to prove that i f  $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the first definition suggested by OP then it is Riemann integrable according to the standard accepted definition of Riemann integrability.    Let's fix an  \\epsilon > 0 . Let  P_{n} = \\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\}  denote equipartition of  [a, b]  so that  x_{i} = a + i(b - a)/n . Let us assume that a  f unction $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable according to the first definition given by OP. Then there exists a number  I  and a positive integer  N  such that  |S(f, P_{n}) - I| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  for all  n > N . Here  S(f, P_{n})  represents a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over equipartition  P_{n}  with any arbitrary set of tags (the notation  S(f, P)  does not explicitly indicate the dependence on tags and it will be augmented later to show this dependence). The important thing to note here is that  N  depends only on  \\epsilon  and not on the choice of tags with partition  P_{n} .    In what follows let us fix a positive integer  n > N . Since  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}  it follows that there is a point  t_{i} \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]  such that  M_{i} - f(t_{i}) < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4(b - a)}  and hence  U(f,P_{n}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) < \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(t_{i})(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} = S(f, P_{n}, t) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  where  S(f, P, t)  is a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over partition  P  and tags  t_{i} .    In a similar manner we can show that there is another set of tags  t_{i}'  for partition  P_{n}  such that  L(f, P_{n}) > S(f, P_{n}, t') - \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  We now have \\begin{align} U( f , P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n}) &= |U(f, P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &= |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t) - I + I - S(f, P_{n}, t')\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &\\leq |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t) - I|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|I - S(f, P_{n}, t')|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &< \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}\\notag\\\\ &= \\epsilon\\notag \\end{align} Therefore by criterion for Riemann integrability $f$ is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  according to the standard definition of Riemann integrability.       On the other hand the second definition suggested by OP (which fixes the tags for a given partition) does not seem amenable to an analysis like the one given in preceding paragraphs. I have not been able to figure out a counter-example to show that this definition is not equivalent to the standard definition. However it does appear that the choice of tags is essential to link the Riemann sums with upper and lower Darboux sums and this is probably an essential ingredient in the definition of Riemann integral.       Update : In the proof presented above I nowhere use the fact that  P_{n}   is a partition of specific form where all sub-intervals are of equal length. In particular we don't assume anything about norm of  P_{n}  . All  I  assume is that there is a sequence of such partitions for which the Riemann sums converge to  I . What is assumed is that the number $I$ does not depend on choice of tags, but the speed of convergence may depend on choice of tags. This will make  N  in the proof to be dependent on the choice of tags. But this is not a problem as we are dealing with only two choices of tags so that we can have  N_{1},N_{2}  in place of  N  and choose  N=\\max(N_{1},N_{2}) .

(Equi v alently, it is the total into  v  minus the total out of $v$.) In your example, after you've pushed that one unit of flow along the top/red path, your total flow is  5  ( 6   u nits out of $u$ minus  1   u nit into  u ).    A natural question is how do you know that your current flow is maximum? For this, you need to try to find  augmenting paths.  Suppose you ha v e a path from  u  to $v$ and yo u  tra v el along that path starting at $u$. The path is called an  augmenting path  if for every edge on the path, the following hold:      If the edge's direction  agrees  with the direction you are going in, then the flow value of that edge is  not  at capacity.    If the edge's direction  goes against  your direction of travel, then that edge has a  positive  flow value on it.       A common mistake is to only look for paths from $u$ to $v$ where each edge agrees with the direction of travel. These  can  be augmenting paths (as your red path is, for example), but you also need to consider other possibilities. In your example,  (u,w,v)  is an augmenting path since edge  (u,v)  goes against your direction of travel but has positive flow value, and the edge  (w,v)  agrees with yo u r direction of tra v el but the flow value is less than capacity.     The point of an augmenting path is that you can \"push\" more flow from $u$ to $v$ along that path by some amount, where you  lessen  the flow along the edges that disagree with your direction of travel and you increase the flow along the edges that do agree with your direction. Of course you want to push as much flow as possible, and if you do this, your path will no longer be augmenting. In your example, you can push a maximum of one unit of flow along the augmenting path  (u,w,v)  and the new flow value on  (u,w)  is \" 3,(0) \" and the new flow value on edge  (w,v)  is \" 5,(2) \".

Then the first digit could be either 0 or 1 (2 possibilities), but the last digit has to be the same as the first (1 possibility). Similarly, the second digit could be either 0 or 1, but the second-last digit has to be the same as the second digit.

It is even possible to define an everywhere (finitely) differentiable function $g$ that has any specified countable set as the set on which $g$ has strict local maxima. See Blazek/Bor\u00e1k/Mal\u00fd [1] (freely available on the internet) and Katznelson/Stromberg [2] for very detailed constructions of such functions. Of course, this can't happen if the function is  C^1  on any interval, so any such function is an example of an everywhere differentiable function whose derivative has a dense set of discontinuities. Curiously, in the Baire category sense,  most everywhere (finitely) differentiable functions on a specified interval have strict local maxima on a (countably) dense subset of that interval and strict local minima on a (countably) dense subset of that interval.  See Weil [3] for the details. This is strengthened in Weil [4], where it is shown that most bounded derivatives on  [0,1]  are discontinuous on a set whose relative complement has Lebesgue measure zero. (Note that this is stronger than is needed for the derivative to not be Riemann integrable on any subinterval of  [0,1],  since for this we only need the discontinuities to have positive measure on every subinterval.) In contrast to this, recall that  every  derivative is continuous on the complement of a first category set, since every derivative is a Baire  1  function. In Bruckner/Petruska [5] (Theorem 2.4) this result for  most  bounded derivatives on  [0,1]  is strengthened to \"on a set whose relative complement has  \\mu -measure zero\" for any specified finite Borel measure  \\mu,  and in Kirchheim [6] (Theorem 2) this result for  most  bounded derivatives on  [0,1]  is strengt h ened to \"on a set whose relative complement has Hausdorff $h$-measure zero\" for any specified Hausdorff measure function  h.  Note that these last results give an abundance of examples such that  [0,1] = A \\cup B , where  A  is about as small as you can ever desire from a measure standpoint and  B  is as large as possible  f rom a Baire category standpoint. Simply take any  Baire typical  bounded everywhere differentiable function $f$ and let  A = C(f)  be the continuity set of  f'  and let  B = D(f)  be the discontinuity set of  f' . And, of course, by using a countable union of appropriate translations of any such decomposition of  [0,1] , we get an analogous decomposition for  \\mathbb R.

First, recall that the brachistochrone is a cycloid, the curve traced by a point on a circle rolling along the  directrix  (dashed line, figures below), which is at the height of zero kinetic energy of the particle.  Thus if the particle starts at rest (as it does in this problem), the directrix is at the height of  A  above t h e \"floor,\"  d enoted $h$.  The  radius  of the circle depends upon the locations of the initial and final points.      If $d$ is small ( d < \\pi h/2 ... half the circumference of a circle that remains above the \"floor\"), then a single cycloid (brachistochrone) can go from  A  to  B  without nee d ing to go through the floor and hence (as the Bernoulli brothers proved) is the optimal solution.       If $d$ is so large that a cycloid would have to pass \"beneath the floor\" (as the poser posits, i.e.,  d>\\pi h/2 ), the solution is to take the cycloid that is tangent  to the farthest possible point on the floor (the point at  (\\pi h/2,0) ), then follow the floor to  (d,0) .    To see this:  Note that the brachistochrone is, by definition, the fastest route to  (\\pi h/2,0) .

Note that the optimal curve is continuous throughout because the cycloid has vanishing derivative at the transition point... the same as the horizontal \"floor.\"       For any point  B  beyond  \\pi h/2 , the  unconstrained  brachistochrone would have to go \"beneath\" the \"floor,\" and is hence unacceptable.

Basically, there are $m$ points and $n$ wal k ers. Wal k ers pic k  points at random, one at a time without replacement, so that after round $k$ each walker has picked $k$ points at random.    If we just look at round $k$ without thinking about the sequential nature of picking points, each walker has picked $k$ points at random, independent of the other walkers.    The question we now ask is:  What is the likelihood  q_k  that whe n  $n$ wal k ers each pick $k$ out of  m  points, all points will be pic k ed by at least one wal k er?    If we can answer that question for any $k$, the likelihood that the last points were picked in round $k$ will be  p_k = q_k-q_{k-1} .    Now, let's keep the nu m ber of points, $m$, and round,  k , fixed a n d instead vary the number of walkers, $n$.    Let the random variable  X_n  be the  n umber of unpicked points when there are $n$ walkers: ie, the likelihood of  X_n=x  for some  x  is the likelihood that with  n  walkers, there will remain e x actly $x$ points not picked by any of the walkers.    If there is only one walker, obviously  X_1=m-k  (ie the likelihood of  X_1=m-k  is one) since that one wal k er has picked $k$ points and  m-k  thus remain unpic k ed.    If there are two walkers, each have picked $k$ points at rando m  out of the $m$ points, so the number of unpicked points follows a  hypergeometric distribution :  X_2\\sim\\text{Hypergeom}(m-k,m-k,m) .    If there are  n  walkers, and the first  n-1  walkers have left  X_{n-1}  poi n ts unpicked, the number of points also not picked by the $n$th walker will be   X_n \\sim \\text{Hypergeom}(X_{n-1},m-k,m)   which basically gives us a recursive expression for  X_n .    I came across this type of iterated hypergeometric distrubutions when studying  sequence shuffling , where I found these could be expressed in terms of  generalised hypergeometric series . To make a long story short,   \\text{E}\\left[ (1+u)^{X_n}\\right] =\\sum_{i=0}^{m-k}    \\frac{[(m-k)(m-k-1)\\cdots(m-k-i+1)]^n}{[m(m-1)\\cdots(m-i+1)]^{n-1}}    \\frac{u^i}{i!} =\\sum_{i=0}^{m-k}    \\frac{\\left(\\frac{(m-k)!}{(m-k-i)!}\\right)^n}     {\\left(\\frac{m!}{(m-i)!}\\right)^{n-1}} \\frac{u^i}{i!}.   I'll show how to derive this further down.    In terms of hypergeometric functions, this is   \\text{E}\\left[ (1+u)^{X_n}\\right] = {}_{n}F_{n-1}(k-m,\\ldots,k-m;-m,\\ldots,-m;-u)   where  {}_{n}F_{n-1}  takes  n  times the parameter  -(m-k)  in the numerator and  n-1  times the parameter  -m  in the denominator.    This gives the probability generating function   \\text{E}\\left[t^{X_n}\\right] = \\sum_{x=0}^m \\Pr[X_n=x]\\cdot t^x =\\sum_{i=0}^{m-k}    \\frac{\\left(\\frac{(m-k)!}{(m-k-i)!}\\right)^n}     {\\left(\\frac{m!}{(m-i)!}\\right)^{n-1}} \\frac{(t-1)^i}{i!} = {}_{n}F_{n-1}(k-m,\\ldots,k-m;-m,\\ldots,-m;1-t).     The likelihood that all points have been picked, ie  \\Pr[X_n=0] , is then found by entering  t=0 :   \\Pr[X_n=0] =\\sum_{i=0}^{m-k}    \\frac{\\left(\\frac{(m-k)!}{(m-k-i)!}\\right)^n}     {\\left(\\frac{m!}{(m-i)!}\\right)^{n-1}} \\frac{(-1)^i}{i!} = {}_{n}F_{n-1}(k-m,\\ldots,k-m;-m,\\ldots,-m;1).     Thus, give n  the $n$ wal k ers and instead varying the number of rounds, the likelihood that all points have been picked in round $k$ or earlier is   q_k = {}_{n}F_{n-1}(k-m,\\ldots,k-m;-m,\\ldots,-m;1)   which makes   p_k = q_k-q_{k-1} = {}_{n}F_{n-1}(k-m,\\ldots,k-m;-m,\\ldots,-m;1)  - {}_{n}F_{n-1}(k-1-m,\\ldots,k-1-m;-m,\\ldots,-m;1).     I recall there is quite a bit of theory about how to compute these, recursions as well as numerical methods, but don't remember all that very well. You should be able to use math packages like Maple or Mathematica to do them. Eg, typing  hypergeom([-3,-3,-3],[-5,-5],1)  into  Wolfram Alpha  gives you  q_2=9/50  for  m=5 ,  n=3 .       Derivation of the hypergeo m etric series:ng>    Given $m$ points and $n$ wal k ers, each picking $k$ points at random, let  X_k  be the numbe r  of points not picked by any walker.    For any selection of $r$ points, the likelihood that a walker has not picked any of these points is  \\binom{m-r}{k}/\\binom{m}{k} : ie the number of ways to pic k  $k$ points from the remaining  m-r  divided by the nu m ber of ways to pick them from from all $m$ poi n ts. Thus, the likelihood that none of the $n$ walke r  pick any of these $r$ points is  [\\binom{m-r}{k}/\\binom{m}{k}]^n .    Since there are  \\binom{m}{r}  diffe r ent ways to pick the  r  points, the expected number of ways to pick $r$ points which none of the walkers have selected is  \\binom{m}{r}\\cdot[\\binom{m-r}{k}/\\binom{m}{k}]^n .    Howeve r , the number of ways to pick $r$ points not picked by any of the walkers can also be expressed as  \\text{E}[\\binom{X_k}{r}] . The equality between the two means that   \\text{E}\\left[\\binom{X_k}{r}\\right] = \\binom{m}{r}\\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\binom{m-r}{k}}{\\binom{m}{k}}\\right)^n = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{(m-k)!}{(m-k-r)!}\\right)^n}     {\\left(\\frac{m!}{(m-r)!}\\right)^{n-1}}   \\cdot\\frac{1}{r!}.   This gives us the desired result:   \\text{E}\\left[(1+u)^{X_k}\\right] = \\sum_{r=0}^m \\text{E}\\left[\\binom{X_k}{r}\\right] u^r = \\sum_{r=0}^m    \\frac{\\left(\\frac{(m-k)!}{(m-k-r)!}\\right)^n}     {\\left(\\frac{m!}{(m-r)!}\\right)^{n-1}}   \\cdot\\frac{u^r}{r!}.        Computed example with  m=6  points and  n=5  walkers:    This makes:   q_1 = \\text{hypergeom}([-5,-5,-5,-5,-5],[-6,-6,-6,-6],1) = 0 \\\\ q_2 = \\text{hypergeom}([-4,-4,-4,-4,-4],[-6,-6,-6,-6],1) = 6026/16875 \\\\ q_3 = \\text{hypergeom}([-3,-3,-3,-3,-3],[-6,-6,-6,-6],1) = 130767/160000 \\\\ q_4 = \\text{hypergeom}([-2,-2,-2,-2,-2],[-6,-6,-6,-6],1) = 49376/50625 \\\\ q_5 = \\text{hypergeom}([-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-6,-6,-6,-6],1) = 1295/1296 \\\\ q_6 = \\text{hypergeom}([-0,-0,-0,-0,-0],[-6,-6,-6,-6],1) = 1   which gives probabilities  p_1=0 ,  p_2=6026/16875\\approx 0.357 ,  p_3=1988053/4320000\\approx 0.460 ,  p_4=2048129/12960000\\approx 0.158 ,  p_5=239/10000=0.0239 ,  p_6=1/1296\\approx 0.00077  for the likelihood  p_k  of having pic k ed all points after round $k$.

Examples are:  l(23)=23 ,  l(24)=3 ,  l(25)=1 . If we ca n  construct a number with digit sum $n$ that is divisible by  l(n) , the n  surely we can make it divisible by $n$ by just adding enough  0 's at the end (equivalent to multiplying it with  10  repeatedly, so this wont change the fact that it is divisible by  l(n) ).

Now the number    \\xi=\\sum_{a\\in A}10^a    has digit sum  n ,  a nd this doesn't depend on the numbers in $a$.

A natural question is how do you know that your current flow is maximum? For this, you need to try to find  augmenting paths.  Suppose you ha v e a path from  u  to $v$ and yo u  tra v el along that path starting at $u$. The path is called an  augmenting path  if for every edge on the path, the following hold:      If the edge's direction  agrees  with the direction you are going in, then the flow value of that edge is  not  at capacity.    If the edge's direction  goes against  your direction of travel, then that edge has a  positive  flow value on it.       A common mistake is to only look for paths from $u$ to $v$ where each edge agrees with the direction of travel. These  can  be augmenting paths (as your red path is, for example), but you also need to consider other possibilities. In your example,  (u,w,v)  is an augmenting path since edge  (u,v)  goes against your direction of travel but has positive flow value, and the edge  (w,v)  agrees with yo u r direction of tra v el but the flow value is less than capacity.     The point of an augmenting path is that you can \"push\" more flow from $u$ to $v$ along that path by some amount, where you  lessen  the flow along the edges that disagree with your direction of travel and you increase the flow along the edges that do agree with your direction. Of course you want to push as much flow as possible, and if you do this, your path will no longer be augmenting. In your example, you can push a maximum of one unit of flow along the augmenting path  (u,w,v)  and the new flow value on  (u,w)  is \" 3,(0) \" and the new flow value on edge  (w,v)  is \" 5,(2) \".

Further we know that the theory of Riemann integration is conveniently studied using Darboux sums instead of Riemann sums and in this connection we have the following result (proof is available in almost any real-analysis textbook):        Criterion for Riemann Integrability :  A function $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  if and only if for every  \\epsilon > 0  there is a partition  P_{\\epsilon}  of  [a, b]  such that  U(f, P_{\\epsilon}) - L(f, P_{\\epsilon}) < \\epsilon  where for any partition  P = \\{a = x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n} = b\\}, x_{i - 1} < x_{i}, i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n  the upper Darboux sum  f or $f$ (denoted by  U(f, P) ) and lower Darboux sum (denoted by  L(f, P) ) is given by  U(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}),\\, L(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}m_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1})  with  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\},\\,m_{i} = \\inf\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}      Using this result it is possible to prove that i f  $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the first definition suggested by OP then it is Riemann integrable according to the standard accepted definition of Riemann integrability.    Let's fix an  \\epsilon > 0 . Let  P_{n} = \\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\}  denote equipartition of  [a, b]  so that  x_{i} = a + i(b - a)/n . Let us assume that a  f unction $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable according to the first definition given by OP. Then there exists a number  I  and a positive integer  N  such that  |S(f, P_{n}) - I| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  for all  n > N . Here  S(f, P_{n})  represents a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over equipartition  P_{n}  with any arbitrary set of tags (the notation  S(f, P)  does not explicitly indicate the dependence on tags and it will be augmented later to show this dependence). The important thing to note here is that  N  depends only on  \\epsilon  and not on the choice of tags with partition  P_{n} .    In what follows let us fix a positive integer  n > N . Since  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}  it follows that there is a point  t_{i} \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]  such that  M_{i} - f(t_{i}) < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4(b - a)}  and hence  U(f,P_{n}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) < \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(t_{i})(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} = S(f, P_{n}, t) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  where  S(f, P, t)  is a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over partition  P  and tags  t_{i} .    In a similar manner we can show that there is another set of tags  t_{i}'  for partition  P_{n}  such that  L(f, P_{n}) > S(f, P_{n}, t') - \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  We now have \\begin{align} U( f , P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n}) &= |U(f, P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &= |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t) - I + I - S(f, P_{n}, t')\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &\\leq |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t) - I|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|I - S(f, P_{n}, t')|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &< \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}\\notag\\\\ &= \\epsilon\\notag \\end{align} Therefore by criterion for Riemann integrability $f$ is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  according to the standard definition of Riemann integrability.       On the other hand the second definition suggested by OP (which fixes the tags for a given partition) does not seem amenable to an analysis like the one given in preceding paragraphs. I have not been able to figure out a counter-example to show that this definition is not equivalent to the standard definition. However it does appear that the choice of tags is essential to link the Riemann sums with upper and lower Darboux sums and this is probably an essential ingredient in the definition of Riemann integral.       Update : In the proof presented above I nowhere use the fact that  P_{n}   is a partition of specific form where all sub-intervals are of equal length. In particular we don't assume anything about norm of  P_{n}  . All  I  assume is that there is a sequence of such partitions for which the Riemann sums converge to  I . What is assumed is that the number $I$ does not depend on choice of tags, but the speed of convergence may depend on choice of tags. This will make  N  in the proof to be dependent on the choice of tags. But this is not a problem as we are dealing with only two choices of tags so that we can have  N_{1},N_{2}  in place of  N  and choose  N=\\max(N_{1},N_{2}) .

If $d$ is so large that a cycloid would have to pass \"beneath the floor\" (as the poser posits, i.e.,  d>\\pi h/2 ), the solution is to take the cycloid that is tangent  to the farthest possible point on the floor (the point at  (\\pi h/2,0) ), then follow the floor to  (d,0) .

Note that the optimal curve is continuous throughout because the cycloid has vanishing derivative at the transition point... the same as the horizontal \"floor.\"       For any point  B  beyond  \\pi h/2 , the  unconstrained  brachistochrone would have to go \"beneath\" the \"floor,\" and is hence unacceptable.

To prove it, first note that, bein g  holomorphic and surjective with connected domain, $g$ is an open map. Thus, continuity o f  $f$ implies t h at $h$ is continuous (this is a general topology argument having nothing to do with complex analysis). Now, remove the set  C_g  of critical points from the domain of  g . On the rest,  g  is locally a fibration, hence, after a local holomorphic coordinate chan g e, $g$ is a coordinate projection. Thus, on the set  \\Omega_2 \\setminus g(C_g)  t h e function $h$ is holomorphic.     Now, we come to an interesting point. If  A_g= g(C_g)  were an analytic subvariety (it is automatically of codimension  \\ge 1  by Sard's theorem), we can simply use Riemann extension theorem which says that if a holomorphic function  F  (of several variables) on the complement to a proper analytic subvariety  A  is bounded at every point of  A  then  F  extends holomorphically over  A .  (Incidentally, I cannot imagine Riemann proving anyt h ing like this; the name probably comes from the fact that standard proofs reduce the problem to the one-dimensional case, where Riemann removable singularities theorem applies.) Thus, in our case, $h$ would analytically extend over  A_g  and we would be done.     In our setting, however,  A_g  need not be an analytic subvariety (we are dealing with, very likely, non-proper maps). Nevertheless, our problem local: We take a small neighborhood  U  of a point  z\\in \\Omega_3 ; then  g(U\\cap C_g)   is contained in a proper analytic subvariety in  \\Omega_2 . (One can eit h er prove it directly or by using a proof of Remmert's proper mapping theorem.) Now,  $h$ extends analytically over  g(U\\cap C_g)  by the argument above.

If we ca n  construct a number with digit sum $n$ that is divisible by  l(n) , the n  surely we can make it divisible by $n$ by just adding enough  0 's at the end (equivalent to multiplying it with  10  repeatedly, so this wont change the fact that it is divisible by  l(n) ).

Now the number    \\xi=\\sum_{a\\in A}10^a    has digit sum  n ,  a nd this doesn't depend on the numbers in $a$.

Then the first digit could be either 0 or 1 (2 possibilities), but the last digit has to be the same as the first (1 possibility). Similarly, the second digit could be either 0 or 1, but the second-last digit has to be the same as the second digit.

First o f  all it is obvious that i f  a function $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the standard definition (the one which involves choice of partition as well as tags) then it is also Riemann integrable according to the two alternative definitions suggested by OP.    Further we know that the theory of Riemann integration is conveniently studied using Darboux sums instead of Riemann sums and in this connection we have the following result (proof is available in almost any real-analysis textbook):        Criterion for Riemann Integrability :  A function $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  if and only if for every  \\epsilon > 0  there is a partition  P_{\\epsilon}  of  [a, b]  such that  U(f, P_{\\epsilon}) - L(f, P_{\\epsilon}) < \\epsilon  where for any partition  P = \\{a = x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n} = b\\}, x_{i - 1} < x_{i}, i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n  the upper Darboux sum  f or $f$ (denoted by  U(f, P) ) and lower Darboux sum (denoted by  L(f, P) ) is given by  U(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}),\\, L(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}m_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1})  with  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\},\\,m_{i} = \\inf\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}      Using this result it is possible to prove that i f  $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the first definition suggested by OP then it is Riemann integrable according to the standard accepted definition of Riemann integrability.    Let's fix an  \\epsilon > 0 . Let  P_{n} = \\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\}  denote equipartition of  [a, b]  so that  x_{i} = a + i(b - a)/n . Let us assume that a  f unction $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable according to the first definition given by OP. Then there exists a number  I  and a positive integer  N  such that  |S(f, P_{n}) - I| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  for all  n > N . Here  S(f, P_{n})  represents a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over equipartition  P_{n}  with any arbitrary set of tags (the notation  S(f, P)  does not explicitly indicate the dependence on tags and it will be augmented later to show this dependence). The important thing to note here is that  N  depends only on  \\epsilon  and not on the choice of tags with partition  P_{n} .    In what follows let us fix a positive integer  n > N . Since  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}  it follows that there is a point  t_{i} \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]  such that  M_{i} - f(t_{i}) < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4(b - a)}  and hence  U(f,P_{n}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) < \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(t_{i})(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} = S(f, P_{n}, t) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  where  S(f, P, t)  is a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over partition  P  and tags  t_{i} .    In a similar manner we can show that there is another set of tags  t_{i}'  for partition  P_{n}  such that  L(f, P_{n}) > S(f, P_{n}, t') - \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  We now have \\begin{align} U( f , P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n}) &= |U(f, P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &= |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t) - I + I - S(f, P_{n}, t')\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &\\leq |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t) - I|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|I - S(f, P_{n}, t')|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &< \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}\\notag\\\\ &= \\epsilon\\notag \\end{align} Therefore by criterion for Riemann integrability $f$ is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  according to the standard definition of Riemann integrability.       On the other hand the second definition suggested by OP (which fixes the tags for a given partition) does not seem amenable to an analysis like the one given in preceding paragraphs. I have not been able to figure out a counter-example to show that this definition is not equivalent to the standard definition. However it does appear that the choice of tags is essential to link the Riemann sums with upper and lower Darboux sums and this is probably an essential ingredient in the definition of Riemann integral.       Update : In the proof presented above I nowhere use the fact that  P_{n}   is a partition of specific form where all sub-intervals are of equal length. In particular we don't assume anything about norm of  P_{n}  . All  I  assume is that there is a sequence of such partitions for which the Riemann sums converge to  I . What is assumed is that the number $I$ does not depend on choice of tags, but the speed of convergence may depend on choice of tags. This will make  N  in the proof to be dependent on the choice of tags. But this is not a problem as we are dealing with only two choices of tags so that we can have  N_{1},N_{2}  in place of  N  and choose  N=\\max(N_{1},N_{2}) .

(Equi v alently, it is the total into  v  minus the total out of $v$.) In your example, after you've pushed that one unit of flow along the top/red path, your total flow is  5  ( 6   u nits out of $u$ minus  1   u nit into  u ).    A natural question is how do you know that your current flow is maximum? For this, you need to try to find  augmenting paths.  Suppose you ha v e a path from  u  to $v$ and yo u  tra v el along that path starting at $u$. The path is called an  augmenting path  if for every edge on the path, the following hold:      If the edge's direction  agrees  with the direction you are going in, then the flow value of that edge is  not  at capacity.    If the edge's direction  goes against  your direction of travel, then that edge has a  positive  flow value on it.       A common mistake is to only look for paths from $u$ to $v$ where each edge agrees with the direction of travel. These  can  be augmenting paths (as your red path is, for example), but you also need to consider other possibilities. In your example,  (u,w,v)  is an augmenting path since edge  (u,v)  goes against your direction of travel but has positive flow value, and the edge  (w,v)  agrees with yo u r direction of tra v el but the flow value is less than capacity.     The point of an augmenting path is that you can \"push\" more flow from $u$ to $v$ along that path by some amount, where you  lessen  the flow along the edges that disagree with your direction of travel and you increase the flow along the edges that do agree with your direction. Of course you want to push as much flow as possible, and if you do this, your path will no longer be augmenting. In your example, you can push a maximum of one unit of flow along the augmenting path  (u,w,v)  and the new flow value on  (u,w)  is \" 3,(0) \" and the new flow value on edge  (w,v)  is \" 5,(2) \".    The theorem you may have seen is:        A  (u,v) -flow is maxim u m if and only if there are no augmenting paths from $u$ to  v .

Let us assume that a  f unction $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable according to the first definition given by OP.

If  g  a n d $n$ are coprime, it gets a bit simpler, because  g^k\\equiv g^{k'} \\pmod{n}  for some  k, k'  with  k>k'   implies   g^{k-k'}\\equiv 1  (you can take the modular inverse because then all  g^k  are copime to  n ), then with  r=k-k' , you have  g^{k+r}\\equiv g^kg^r\\equiv g^k  for all  k    If  g  a n d $n$ are not coprime, it's not as simple:  if   g^r \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}  fo r  some $r$ then  g^{k+r}\\equiv g^kg^r\\equiv 0  for all  k . But you may also have a repeating sequence without any  1 , for example, modulo  15 ,    3^0\\equiv1,\\; 3^1\\equiv3,\\; 3^2\\equiv9,\\; 3^3\\equiv12,\\; 3^4\\equiv6,\\; 3^5\\equiv3\\pmod{15}    And it starts repeating after  3^4 , with numbers not coprime to  15  since  g=3  is  n ot coprime to $n$ either. And actually, if  g  a n d $n$ are not coprime, you never get a  1  again after  g^0\\equiv1 \\pmod{n} , because all  g^k  have a commo n  factor with $n$.

First o f  all it is obvious that i f  a function $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the standard definition (the one which involves choice of partition as well as tags) then it is also Riemann integrable according to the two alternative definitions suggested by OP.    Further we know that the theory of Riemann integration is conveniently studied using Darboux sums instead of Riemann sums and in this connection we have the following result (proof is available in almost any real-analysis textbook):        Criterion for Riemann Integrability :  A function $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  if and only if for every  \\epsilon > 0  there is a partition  P_{\\epsilon}  of  [a, b]  such that  U(f, P_{\\epsilon}) - L(f, P_{\\epsilon}) < \\epsilon  where for any partition  P = \\{a = x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n} = b\\}, x_{i - 1} < x_{i}, i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n  the upper Darboux sum  f or $f$ (denoted by  U(f, P) ) and lower Darboux sum (denoted by  L(f, P) ) is given by  U(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}),\\, L(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}m_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1})  with  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\},\\,m_{i} = \\inf\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}      Using this result it is possible to prove that i f  $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the first definition suggested by OP then it is Riemann integrable according to the standard accepted definition of Riemann integrability.    Let's fix an  \\epsilon > 0 . Let  P_{n} = \\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\}  denote equipartition of  [a, b]  so that  x_{i} = a + i(b - a)/n . Let us assume that a  f unction $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable according to the first definition given by OP. Then there exists a number  I  and a positive integer  N  such that  |S(f, P_{n}) - I| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  for all  n > N . Here  S(f, P_{n})  represents a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over equipartition  P_{n}  with any arbitrary set of tags (the notation  S(f, P)  does not explicitly indicate the dependence on tags and it will be augmented later to show this dependence). The important thing to note here is that  N  depends only on  \\epsilon  and not on the choice of tags with partition  P_{n} .    In what follows let us fix a positive integer  n > N . Since  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}  it follows that there is a point  t_{i} \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]  such that  M_{i} - f(t_{i}) < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4(b - a)}  and hence  U(f,P_{n}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) < \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(t_{i})(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} = S(f, P_{n}, t) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  where  S(f, P, t)  is a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over partition  P  and tags  t_{i} .    In a similar manner we can show that there is another set of tags  t_{i}'  for partition  P_{n}  such that  L(f, P_{n}) > S(f, P_{n}, t') - \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  We now have \\begin{align} U( f , P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n}) &= |U(f, P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &= |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t) - I + I - S(f, P_{n}, t')\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &\\leq |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t) - I|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|I - S(f, P_{n}, t')|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &< \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}\\notag\\\\ &= \\epsilon\\notag \\end{align} Therefore by criterion for Riemann integrability $f$ is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  according to the standard definition of Riemann integrability.       On the other hand the second definition suggested by OP (which fixes the tags for a given partition) does not seem amenable to an analysis like the one given in preceding paragraphs. I have not been able to figure out a counter-example to show that this definition is not equivalent to the standard definition. However it does appear that the choice of tags is essential to link the Riemann sums with upper and lower Darboux sums and this is probably an essential ingredient in the definition of Riemann integral.       Update : In the proof presented above I nowhere use the fact that  P_{n}   is a partition of specific form where all sub-intervals are of equal length. In particular we don't assume anything about norm of  P_{n}  . All  I  assume is that there is a sequence of such partitions for which the Riemann sums converge to  I . What is assumed is that the number $I$ does not depend on choice of tags, but the speed of convergence may depend on choice of tags. This will make  N  in the proof to be dependent on the choice of tags. But this is not a problem as we are dealing with only two choices of tags so that we can have  N_{1},N_{2}  in place of  N  and choose  N=\\max(N_{1},N_{2}) .

On the other hand, if we assume that  A^{p^n} = I  for some  n  then we have  (A - I)^{p^n} = A^{p^n} - I = 0  so  A  is unipotent.

It feels annoyingly complicated to me; I don't know if a substantially simpler proof is possible.         Theorem (Maschke):  Let $k$ be a field and let  G  be a finite group. Then  k[G]  is semisimple iff the characteristic of  k  does not divide  |G| .  kquote>   Proof.  First suppose that the characteristic of $k$ divides  |G| ; call it  p . We will use the fact that a finite-dimensional  k -algebra is semisimple iff its  Jacobson radical  vanishes (see e.g.  this blog post ). Our goal will be to exhibit an element of  k[G]  in its Jacobson radical. Let    s = \\sum_{g \\in G} g \\in k[G].    Note that  gs = s  for all  g \\in G  and that  s^2 = |G| s = 0 ; in particular,  s  i s  nilpotent, but moreover the left ideal generated by  s , which con s ists of scalar multiples of $s$, consists of nilpotent elements. It follows that $s$ is a nonzero element of the Jacobson radical of  k[G] , and hence that  k[G]  is not semisimple.     Now suppose that the characteristic of  k  does not divide  |G| ; call it  p . Recall that if  A  is any finite-dimensional  k -algebra, then there is a canonical linear functional on  A  called the  trace    \\text{tr}(a) = \\text{tr}(L_a), L_a : A \\ni x \\mapsto ax \\in A.    That is,  \\text{tr}(a)  is the tr a ce of $a$ acting on  A  by left multiplication. The trace induces a symmetric bilinear form on  A  called the  trace form   \\langle a, b \\rangle = \\text{tr}(ab) . Recall that a bilinear form on a vector space is  nondegenerate  if  a \\neq 0  implies that there exists some  b  such that  \\langle a, b \\rangle \\neq 0 .         Lemma:  If the trace form on  A  is nondegenerate, then  A  is semisimple.      Proof.  Let  j \\in J(A)  be an element of the Jacobson radical of  A . On a finite-dimensional  k -algebra,  J(A)  can be characterized as the largest nilpotent right ideal of  A . Hence if  b \\in A , then  jb \\in J(A)  is nilpotent. By passing to an algebraic closure of  k  and upper-triangularizing the action of  jb  on  A  by left multiplication we see that the eigenvalues of  jb  are all zero, so  \\text{tr}(jb) = \\langle j, b \\rangle = 0 .

First o f  all it is obvious that i f  a function $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the standard definition (the one which involves choice of partition as well as tags) then it is also Riemann integrable according to the two alternative definitions suggested by OP.    Further we know that the theory of Riemann integration is conveniently studied using Darboux sums instead of Riemann sums and in this connection we have the following result (proof is available in almost any real-analysis textbook):        Criterion for Riemann Integrability :  A function $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  if and only if for every  \\epsilon > 0  there is a partition  P_{\\epsilon}  of  [a, b]  such that  U(f, P_{\\epsilon}) - L(f, P_{\\epsilon}) < \\epsilon  where for any partition  P = \\{a = x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n} = b\\}, x_{i - 1} < x_{i}, i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n  the upper Darboux sum  f or $f$ (denoted by  U(f, P) ) and lower Darboux sum (denoted by  L(f, P) ) is given by  U(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}),\\, L(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}m_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1})  with  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\},\\,m_{i} = \\inf\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}      Using this result it is possible to prove that i f  $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the first definition suggested by OP then it is Riemann integrable according to the standard accepted definition of Riemann integrability.    Let's fix an  \\epsilon > 0 . Let  P_{n} = \\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\}  denote equipartition of  [a, b]  so that  x_{i} = a + i(b - a)/n . Let us assume that a  f unction $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable according to the first definition given by OP. Then there exists a number  I  and a positive integer  N  such that  |S(f, P_{n}) - I| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  for all  n > N . Here  S(f, P_{n})  represents a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over equipartition  P_{n}  with any arbitrary set of tags (the notation  S(f, P)  does not explicitly indicate the dependence on tags and it will be augmented later to show this dependence). The important thing to note here is that  N  depends only on  \\epsilon  and not on the choice of tags with partition  P_{n} .    In what follows let us fix a positive integer  n > N . Since  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}  it follows that there is a point  t_{i} \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]  such that  M_{i} - f(t_{i}) < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4(b - a)}  and hence  U(f,P_{n}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) < \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(t_{i})(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} = S(f, P_{n}, t) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  where  S(f, P, t)  is a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over partition  P  and tags  t_{i} .    In a similar manner we can show that there is another set of tags  t_{i}'  for partition  P_{n}  such that  L(f, P_{n}) > S(f, P_{n}, t') - \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  We now have \\begin{align} U( f , P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n}) &= |U(f, P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &= |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t) - I + I - S(f, P_{n}, t')\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &\\leq |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t) - I|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|I - S(f, P_{n}, t')|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &< \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}\\notag\\\\ &= \\epsilon\\notag \\end{align} Therefore by criterion for Riemann integrability $f$ is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  according to the standard definition of Riemann integrability.       On the other hand the second definition suggested by OP (which fixes the tags for a given partition) does not seem amenable to an analysis like the one given in preceding paragraphs. I have not been able to figure out a counter-example to show that this definition is not equivalent to the standard definition. However it does appear that the choice of tags is essential to link the Riemann sums with upper and lower Darboux sums and this is probably an essential ingredient in the definition of Riemann integral.       Update : In the proof presented above I nowhere use the fact that  P_{n}   is a partition of specific form where all sub-intervals are of equal length. In particular we don't assume anything about norm of  P_{n}  . All  I  assume is that there is a sequence of such partitions for which the Riemann sums converge to  I . What is assumed is that the number $I$ does not depend on choice of tags, but the speed of convergence may depend on choice of tags. This will make  N  in the proof to be dependent on the choice of tags. But this is not a problem as we are dealing with only two choices of tags so that we can have  N_{1},N_{2}  in place of  N  and choose  N=\\max(N_{1},N_{2}) .

So first I'd like to remark on your original question about general systems of polynomial equations. In the comments I said solving your system is relatively easy because it concerns only polynomials of low degree (in fact it it reduces to a system of equations of degree at most  2 ). In spite of my unpleasantly long and cumbersome answer I stand by this comment; in general, solving systems with (many) polynomials of higher degrees is a very ad hoc matter, and is more often than not practically intractible.       In finding all solutions I'll assume familiarity with basic linear algebra; some vector and matrix notation, and solving systems of linear equations. Let  {\\bf1}_n=(1,1,\\ldots,1)\\in\\Bbb{R}^n , let  K_i':=\\tfrac{K_i}{f}  and define  x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4\\in\\Bbb{R}^n  as  x_j:=(x_{ij})_{1\\leq i\\leq n}.

Also note that the variables  x_{24},\\ldots,x_{n4}  appear only in the first equation, which is linear and hence easy to solve. So will omit the first equation from now on.

And maybe you are asking for a com p ariso n  of the bi n omial a n d the hypergeometric probability distributions.    Binomial.  If we are sampling from an (essentially) infinite population, or from a finite population without replacement, then the binomial distribution applies. The number of observations is denoted $n$ and the probability of a certain occurrence, often generically called as Success is $p$.    Examples:  (1) Many public opinion polls sample $n$ people from the population of a state, where $n$ is several hundred or maybe as large as a couple of thousand, and the number of people in the state is several million. An answer in favor of a particular candidate might be called a Success. (2) We roll a fair die $n$ times and the probability of getting a 6 (a Success) on each roll is  p = 1/6 . Conceivably, the die can be rolled infinitely many times.     In both of these examples, questions about the number  X  of Successes we may see out of  n  can be answered using the binomial distribution. The mean number of successes is  \\mu = np  and the variance of the number of successes is  \\sigma^2 = np(1-p).  Furthermore, as you suggest, there are situations in which it is convenient and reasonably accurate to approximate binomial probabilities using a normal distribution with mean  \\mu  and variance  \\sigma^2.    ng>Hypergeometric: If you are sampling $n$ items for a population of finite size  N , the n  the situation changes somewhat. The main issue is that the population may become depleted as the sampling goes forward. Roughly speaking, the effects of this depletion begin to be important when the sample size $n$ gets to be more than about 10% of the population size  N.    Example:  You are choosing  n = 20  computer chips out of a shipment of  N = 100  in order to see if they are good (a Success) or bad. Maybe there are 80 good chips among the 100 so that the proportion of Successes is  p = 90/100 = 0.9 . With random sampling, this is also the probability of Success as each chip is chosen for testing. You do not put a chip back with the untested chips, so when you are getting ready choose the last of the 20 chips, you are sampling from a reduced population of only 81 untested chips. Let  X  be the number of Successes (good chips) out of  n = 20 . The average number is  \\mu = np = 20(90/100) = 20(.9) = 18.  This formula is essentially the same as the formula for the mean of a binomial distribution. However, the variance of  X  is   \\sigma^2 = np(1-p)\\frac{N-n}{N-1} = 20(.9)(.1)(80/99) = 1.4545.    This formula for the variance is similar to the formula for the variance of a binomial distribution, but  not  exactly the same. The difference is the last factor. It is easy to see that this factor  (N-n)/(N-1)  tends to 1 as  N \\rightarrow \\infty.      Again here, in appropriate circumstances, it may be useful to approximate probabilities involving  X  using a normal distribution with mean  \\mu  and variance  \\sigma^2.    So it is correct that in the finite population (hypergeometric) case, that a \"correction\" needs to be made, and also that the correction becomes negligible for huge  N.  The differences from your guess in the formula with  A  and  B , are twofold: (a) there is no correction in the mean  \\mu  and (b) the correction to the variance  \\sigma^2  is a multiplicative factor rather than a term that needs to be added on.

A natural question is how do you know that your current flow is maximum? For this, you need to try to find  augmenting paths.  Suppose you ha v e a path from  u  to $v$ and yo u  tra v el along that path starting at $u$. The path is called an  augmenting path  if for every edge on the path, the following hold:      If the edge's direction  agrees  with the direction you are going in, then the flow value of that edge is  not  at capacity.    If the edge's direction  goes against  your direction of travel, then that edge has a  positive  flow value on it.       A common mistake is to only look for paths from $u$ to $v$ where each edge agrees with the direction of travel. These  can  be augmenting paths (as your red path is, for example), but you also need to consider other possibilities. In your example,  (u,w,v)  is an augmenting path since edge  (u,v)  goes against your direction of travel but has positive flow value, and the edge  (w,v)  agrees with yo u r direction of tra v el but the flow value is less than capacity.     The point of an augmenting path is that you can \"push\" more flow from $u$ to $v$ along that path by some amount, where you  lessen  the flow along the edges that disagree with your direction of travel and you increase the flow along the edges that do agree with your direction. Of course you want to push as much flow as possible, and if you do this, your path will no longer be augmenting. In your example, you can push a maximum of one unit of flow along the augmenting path  (u,w,v)  and the new flow value on  (u,w)  is \" 3,(0) \" and the new flow value on edge  (w,v)  is \" 5,(2) \".

First o f  all it is obvious that i f  a function $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the standard definition (the one which involves choice of partition as well as tags) then it is also Riemann integrable according to the two alternative definitions suggested by OP.    Further we know that the theory of Riemann integration is conveniently studied using Darboux sums instead of Riemann sums and in this connection we have the following result (proof is available in almost any real-analysis textbook):        Criterion for Riemann Integrability :  A function $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  if and only if for every  \\epsilon > 0  there is a partition  P_{\\epsilon}  of  [a, b]  such that  U(f, P_{\\epsilon}) - L(f, P_{\\epsilon}) < \\epsilon  where for any partition  P = \\{a = x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n} = b\\}, x_{i - 1} < x_{i}, i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n  the upper Darboux sum  f or $f$ (denoted by  U(f, P) ) and lower Darboux sum (denoted by  L(f, P) ) is given by  U(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}),\\, L(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}m_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1})  with  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\},\\,m_{i} = \\inf\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}      Using this result it is possible to prove that i f  $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the first definition suggested by OP then it is Riemann integrable according to the standard accepted definition of Riemann integrability.    Let's fix an  \\epsilon > 0 . Let  P_{n} = \\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\}  denote equipartition of  [a, b]  so that  x_{i} = a + i(b - a)/n . Let us assume that a  f unction $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable according to the first definition given by OP. Then there exists a number  I  and a positive integer  N  such that  |S(f, P_{n}) - I| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  for all  n > N . Here  S(f, P_{n})  represents a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over equipartition  P_{n}  with any arbitrary set of tags (the notation  S(f, P)  does not explicitly indicate the dependence on tags and it will be augmented later to show this dependence). The important thing to note here is that  N  depends only on  \\epsilon  and not on the choice of tags with partition  P_{n} .    In what follows let us fix a positive integer  n > N . Since  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}  it follows that there is a point  t_{i} \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]  such that  M_{i} - f(t_{i}) < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4(b - a)}  and hence  U(f,P_{n}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) < \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(t_{i})(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} = S(f, P_{n}, t) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  where  S(f, P, t)  is a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over partition  P  and tags  t_{i} .    In a similar manner we can show that there is another set of tags  t_{i}'  for partition  P_{n}  such that  L(f, P_{n}) > S(f, P_{n}, t') - \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  We now have \\begin{align} U( f , P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n}) &= |U(f, P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &= |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t) - I + I - S(f, P_{n}, t')\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &\\leq |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t) - I|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|I - S(f, P_{n}, t')|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &< \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}\\notag\\\\ &= \\epsilon\\notag \\end{align} Therefore by criterion for Riemann integrability $f$ is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  according to the standard definition of Riemann integrability.       On the other hand the second definition suggested by OP (which fixes the tags for a given partition) does not seem amenable to an analysis like the one given in preceding paragraphs. I have not been able to figure out a counter-example to show that this definition is not equivalent to the standard definition. However it does appear that the choice of tags is essential to link the Riemann sums with upper and lower Darboux sums and this is probably an essential ingredient in the definition of Riemann integral.       Update : In the proof presented above I nowhere use the fact that  P_{n}   is a partition of specific form where all sub-intervals are of equal length. In particular we don't assume anything about norm of  P_{n}  . All  I  assume is that there is a sequence of such partitions for which the Riemann sums converge to  I . What is assumed is that the number $I$ does not depend on choice of tags, but the speed of convergence may depend on choice of tags.

For example,  $4 \\downarrow 3 = 4 \\downarrow \\downarrow (4 \\downarrow \\downarrow 4) = 4 \\downarrow \\downarrow (4 + 1) = (4 + 1) + 1 = 6 = 4 + 3 - 1$ . But it is really close; perhaps we need an exception, such as  $$\\begin{align*} a \\downarrow \\downarrow b = \\begin{cases}b + 1 & \\text{if } a < b \\\\ b + 2 & \\text{if } a = b \\end{cases}\\end{align*}.$$  The case  $a > b$  does not show up when evaluating  $a \\downarrow b$ , but it will be need to be defined if we try to extend further to  $a \\downarrow \\downarrow \\downarrow b$ . For instance, we could abuse the fact that the case  $a > b$  is allowed to be anything, and let  $$a \\downarrow \\downarrow b = b + 1 + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{a}{b} \\right\\rfloor,$$  but finding  $a \\downarrow \\downarrow \\downarrow b$  may be intractable as a result.

Examples are:  l(23)=23 ,  l(24)=3 ,  l(25)=1 . If we ca n  construct a number with digit sum $n$ that is divisible by  l(n) , the n  surely we can make it divisible by $n$ by just adding enough  0 's at the end (equivalent to multiplying it with  10  repeatedly, so this wont change the fact that it is divisible by  l(n) ). Let  A  be a set of  n  non-negative integers, that is,  A\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}_0  and  |A|=n . Now the number    \\xi=\\sum_{a\\in A}10^a    has digit sum  n ,  a nd this doesn't depend on the numbers in $a$. For it to be divisible by  l(n) , we'd need    \\xi=\\sum_{a\\in A}10^a\\equiv 0\\mod l(n)    and since  10^{\\phi(l(n))}\\equiv1\\mod l(n)  (note that we use  \\gcd(10,l(n))=1  here), we can choose    A=\\{0\\cdot\\phi(l(n)),1\\cdot\\phi(l(n)),2\\cdot\\phi(l(n)),\\cdots,(n-1)\\cdot\\phi(l(n))\\}    so that we get (all equivalences are  \\mod l(n) ): \\begin{align} \\xi&\\equiv\\sum_{a\\in A}10^a\\\\ &\\equiv\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}10^{k\\cdot\\phi(l(n))}\\\\ &\\equiv\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\\left(10^{\\phi(l(n))}\\right)^{k}\\\\ &\\equiv\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}1^{k}\\\\ &\\equiv\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}1\\\\ &\\equiv n\\\\ &\\equiv 0\\mod l(n) \\end{align} where the last,  n\\equiv0\\mod l(n) , holds since  l(n)\\mid n , because  l(n)  has the same factors as  n  and maybe a little less, but never more. Now we can append enough zeroes at the end so that it is not only divisible by  l(n) , but also by  n .

First o f  all it is obvious that i f  a function $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the standard definition (the one which involves choice of partition as well as tags) then it is also Riemann integrable according to the two alternative definitions suggested by OP.    Further we know that the theory of Riemann integration is conveniently studied using Darboux sums instead of Riemann sums and in this connection we have the following result (proof is available in almost any real-analysis textbook):        Criterion for Riemann Integrability :  A function $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  if and only if for every  \\epsilon > 0  there is a partition  P_{\\epsilon}  of  [a, b]  such that  U(f, P_{\\epsilon}) - L(f, P_{\\epsilon}) < \\epsilon  where for any partition  P = \\{a = x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n} = b\\}, x_{i - 1} < x_{i}, i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n  the upper Darboux sum  f or $f$ (denoted by  U(f, P) ) and lower Darboux sum (denoted by  L(f, P) ) is given by  U(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}),\\, L(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}m_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1})  with  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\},\\,m_{i} = \\inf\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}      Using this result it is possible to prove that i f  $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the first definition suggested by OP then it is Riemann integrable according to the standard accepted definition of Riemann integrability.    Let's fix an  \\epsilon > 0 . Let  P_{n} = \\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\}  denote equipartition of  [a, b]  so that  x_{i} = a + i(b - a)/n . Let us assume that a  f unction $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable according to the first definition given by OP. Then there exists a number  I  and a positive integer  N  such that  |S(f, P_{n}) - I| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  for all  n > N . Here  S(f, P_{n})  represents a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over equipartition  P_{n}  with any arbitrary set of tags (the notation  S(f, P)  does not explicitly indicate the dependence on tags and it will be augmented later to show this dependence). The important thing to note here is that  N  depends only on  \\epsilon  and not on the choice of tags with partition  P_{n} .    In what follows let us fix a positive integer  n > N . Since  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}  it follows that there is a point  t_{i} \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]  such that  M_{i} - f(t_{i}) < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4(b - a)}  and hence  U(f,P_{n}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) < \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(t_{i})(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} = S(f, P_{n}, t) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  where  S(f, P, t)  is a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over partition  P  and tags  t_{i} .    In a similar manner we can show that there is another set of tags  t_{i}'  for partition  P_{n}  such that  L(f, P_{n}) > S(f, P_{n}, t') - \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  We now have \\begin{align} U( f , P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n}) &= |U(f, P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &= |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t) - I + I - S(f, P_{n}, t')\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &\\leq |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t) - I|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|I - S(f, P_{n}, t')|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &< \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}\\notag\\\\ &= \\epsilon\\notag \\end{align} Therefore by criterion for Riemann integrability $f$ is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  according to the standard definition of Riemann integrability.       On the other hand the second definition suggested by OP (which fixes the tags for a given partition) does not seem amenable to an analysis like the one given in preceding paragraphs. I have not been able to figure out a counter-example to show that this definition is not equivalent to the standard definition. However it does appear that the choice of tags is essential to link the Riemann sums with upper and lower Darboux sums and this is probably an essential ingredient in the definition of Riemann integral.       Update : In the proof presented above I nowhere use the fact that  P_{n}   is a partition of specific form where all sub-intervals are of equal length. In particular we don't assume anything about norm of  P_{n}  . All  I  assume is that there is a sequence of such partitions for which the Riemann sums converge to  I . What is assumed is that the number $I$ does not depend on choice of tags, but the speed of convergence may depend on choice of tags. This will make  N  in the proof to be dependent on the choice of tags. But this is not a problem as we are dealing with only two choices of tags so that we can have  N_{1},N_{2}  in place of  N  and choose  N=\\max(N_{1},N_{2}) .

First o f  all it is obvious that i f  a function $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the standard definition (the one which involves choice of partition as well as tags) then it is also Riemann integrable according to the two alternative definitions suggested by OP.    Further we know that the theory of Riemann integration is conveniently studied using Darboux sums instead of Riemann sums and in this connection we have the following result (proof is available in almost any real-analysis textbook):        Criterion for Riemann Integrability :  A function $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  if and only if for every  \\epsilon > 0  there is a partition  P_{\\epsilon}  of  [a, b]  such that  U(f, P_{\\epsilon}) - L(f, P_{\\epsilon}) < \\epsilon  where for any partition  P = \\{a = x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n} = b\\}, x_{i - 1} < x_{i}, i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n  the upper Darboux sum  f or $f$ (denoted by  U(f, P) ) and lower Darboux sum (denoted by  L(f, P) ) is given by  U(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}),\\, L(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}m_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1})  with  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\},\\,m_{i} = \\inf\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}      Using this result it is possible to prove that i f  $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the first definition suggested by OP then it is Riemann integrable according to the standard accepted definition of Riemann integrability.    Let's fix an  \\epsilon > 0 . Let  P_{n} = \\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\}  denote equipartition of  [a, b]  so that  x_{i} = a + i(b - a)/n . Let us assume that a  f unction $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable according to the first definition given by OP. Then there exists a number  I  and a positive integer  N  such that  |S(f, P_{n}) - I| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  for all  n > N . Here  S(f, P_{n})  represents a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over equipartition  P_{n}  with any arbitrary set of tags (the notation  S(f, P)  does not explicitly indicate the dependence on tags and it will be augmented later to show this dependence). The important thing to note here is that  N  depends only on  \\epsilon  and not on the choice of tags with partition  P_{n} .    In what follows let us fix a positive integer  n > N . Since  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}  it follows that there is a point  t_{i} \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]  such that  M_{i} - f(t_{i}) < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4(b - a)}  and hence  U(f,P_{n}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) < \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(t_{i})(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} = S(f, P_{n}, t) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  where  S(f, P, t)  is a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over partition  P  and tags  t_{i} .    In a similar manner we can show that there is another set of tags  t_{i}'  for partition  P_{n}  such that  L(f, P_{n}) > S(f, P_{n}, t') - \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  We now have \\begin{align} U( f , P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n}) &= |U(f, P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &= |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t) - I + I - S(f, P_{n}, t')\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &\\leq |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t) - I|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|I - S(f, P_{n}, t')|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &< \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}\\notag\\\\ &= \\epsilon\\notag \\end{align} Therefore by criterion for Riemann integrability $f$ is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  according to the standard definition of Riemann integrability.       On the other hand the second definition suggested by OP (which fixes the tags for a given partition) does not seem amenable to an analysis like the one given in preceding paragraphs. I have not been able to figure out a counter-example to show that this definition is not equivalent to the standard definition. However it does appear that the choice of tags is essential to link the Riemann sums with upper and lower Darboux sums and this is probably an essential ingredient in the definition of Riemann integral.       Update : In the proof presented above I nowhere use the fact that  P_{n}   is a partition of specific form where all sub-intervals are of equal length. In particular we don't assume anything about norm of  P_{n}  . All  I  assume is that there is a sequence of such partitions for which the Riemann sums converge to  I . What is assumed is that the number $I$ does not depend on choice of tags, but the speed of convergence may depend on choice of tags. This will make  N  in the proof to be dependent on the choice of tags. But this is not a problem as we are dealing with only two choices of tags so that we can have  N_{1},N_{2}  in place of  N  and choose  N=\\max(N_{1},N_{2}) .

If we ca n  construct a number with digit sum $n$ that is divisible by  l(n) , the n  surely we can make it divisible by $n$ by just adding enough  0 's at the end (equivalent to multiplying it with  10  repeatedly, so this wont change the fact that it is divisible by  l(n) ).

In your example, after you've pushed that one unit of flow along the top/red path, your total flow is  5  ( 6   u nits out of $u$ minus  1   u nit into  u ).    A natural question is how do you know that your current flow is maximum? For this, you need to try to find  augmenting paths.  Suppose you ha v e a path from  u  to $v$ and yo u  tra v el along that path starting at $u$. The path is called an  augmenting path  if for every edge on the path, the following hold:      If the edge's direction  agrees  with the direction you are going in, then the flow value of that edge is  not  at capacity.    If the edge's direction  goes against  your direction of travel, then that edge has a  positive  flow value on it.       A common mistake is to only look for paths from $u$ to $v$ where each edge agrees with the direction of travel. These  can  be augmenting paths (as your red path is, for example), but you also need to consider other possibilities. In your example,  (u,w,v)  is an augmenting path since edge  (u,v)  goes against your direction of travel but has positive flow value, and the edge  (w,v)  agrees with yo u r direction of tra v el but the flow value is less than capacity.     The point of an augmenting path is that you can \"push\" more flow from $u$ to $v$ along that path by some amount, where you  lessen  the flow along the edges that disagree with your direction of travel and you increase the flow along the edges that do agree with your direction. Of course you want to push as much flow as possible, and if you do this, your path will no longer be augmenting. In your example, you can push a maximum of one unit of flow along the augmenting path  (u,w,v)  and the new flow value on  (u,w)  is \" 3,(0) \" and the new flow value on edge  (w,v)  is \" 5,(2) \".

The  log  function plays an important role in understanding algorithm complexity! The tree property can help to find fast algorithms for a problem.        Logarithms are also really helpful in the way that J.M. suggested in the comment to your question: getting minute quantities to a more usable scale.     A good example: probabilities.     In tasks such as speech-to-text programs and many other language-related computational problems, you deal with strings of elements (such as sentences composed of words) where each has an associated probability (numbers between 0 and 1, often near zero, such as  0.00763 ,  0.034  and  0.000069 ). To get the total probability over all such elements, i.e. the whole sentence, the individual probabilities are all multiplicated: for example  0.00763 * 0.034 * 0.000069 , which yields  0.00000001789998 . Those numbers would soon get too small for computers to handle easily, given that you want to use normal 32-bit precision (and even double precision does have its limits and you never know exactly how small the probabilites might get!) If that happens, the results become inaccurate and might even be rounded down to zero, which means that the whole calculation is lost.    However, if you  \u2013log-transform  those numbers, you get two important advantages:      the numbers stay in a range which is easily expressed in 32-bit floating point numbers;   you can simply add the logarithmic values, which is the same as multiplying the original values, and addition is much faster in terms of processing time than multiplication. Example:       \u2013log(0.00763) = 2.11747...  (more places are irrelevant)   \u2013log(0.034) = 1.46852...   \u2013log(0.000069) = 4.16115...   2,11747 + 1,46852 + 4,16115 = 7.74714   10 \u20137.74714  = 0.00000001790028...      that's really, really close to the original number and we only had to keep track of six places per intermediate number!

The small cone is similar in proportion to the large cone.    So, if the hole is of radius $a$, the big cone has height $h$ and base $b$, then the small cone has height  h^* = \\frac{a}{b}h   a nd r a dius $a$.

Regardless of how the cycle is coloured, each branching tree can then be coloured with only two colours (the colour of the vertex on the cycle and another colour), which does not change the fact that  \\chi(G)\\le3  in all cases.

First, note that the notion of an inner automorphism is not universal in the sense that any automorphism $u$ of a group  G , can be considered as inner in a larger group (consider for instance the semi-direct product of  G  and  u ).    Now working with a fixed group  G , some of the propeties of the inner automorphisms (unfortunately, shared with other automorphisms) is that they act trivially on the center, they preserve conjugacy classes and act trivially on  G/G' .  However, these facts are in general so vague to decide whether an automorphism is inner or not.    A more powerful method is using cohomology (is some cases), for instance if our group contains a self centralizing normal subgroup  N , one has an isomorphism between the group of  1 -cocycles  Z^1(G/N, Z(N))  and the group of automorphisms acting trivially on  G/Z(N)  and  N , and this isomorphism maps the subgroup of  1 -cobords exactely to the group of inner automorphisms acting trivially on  G/Z(N)  and  N .  So, the problem of having a non inner automorphism in this class amounts to proving that the cohomology group  H^1(G/N, Z(N))  is not trivial.  This interesting relation was used by Gaschutz in proving his famous result, that every finite non-simple p-group has outer automorphisms.    Finally, I note that there is many outstanding problems related to deciding that some automorphisms are inner or not, and the existing tools seem to be very unsatisfactory.

First o f  all it is obvious that i f  a function $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the standard definition (the one which involves choice of partition as well as tags) then it is also Riemann integrable according to the two alternative definitions suggested by OP.    Further we know that the theory of Riemann integration is conveniently studied using Darboux sums instead of Riemann sums and in this connection we have the following result (proof is available in almost any real-analysis textbook):        Criterion for Riemann Integrability :  A function $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  if and only if for every  \\epsilon > 0  there is a partition  P_{\\epsilon}  of  [a, b]  such that  U(f, P_{\\epsilon}) - L(f, P_{\\epsilon}) < \\epsilon  where for any partition  P = \\{a = x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n} = b\\}, x_{i - 1} < x_{i}, i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n  the upper Darboux sum  f or $f$ (denoted by  U(f, P) ) and lower Darboux sum (denoted by  L(f, P) ) is given by  U(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}),\\, L(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}m_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1})  with  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\},\\,m_{i} = \\inf\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}      Using this result it is possible to prove that i f  $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the first definition suggested by OP then it is Riemann integrable according to the standard accepted definition of Riemann integrability.    Let's fix an  \\epsilon > 0 . Let  P_{n} = \\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\}  denote equipartition of  [a, b]  so that  x_{i} = a + i(b - a)/n . Let us assume that a  f unction $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable according to the first definition given by OP. Then there exists a number  I  and a positive integer  N  such that  |S(f, P_{n}) - I| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  for all  n > N . Here  S(f, P_{n})  represents a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over equipartition  P_{n}  with any arbitrary set of tags (the notation  S(f, P)  does not explicitly indicate the dependence on tags and it will be augmented later to show this dependence). The important thing to note here is that  N  depends only on  \\epsilon  and not on the choice of tags with partition  P_{n} .    In what follows let us fix a positive integer  n > N . Since  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}  it follows that there is a point  t_{i} \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]  such that  M_{i} - f(t_{i}) < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4(b - a)}  and hence  U(f,P_{n}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) < \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(t_{i})(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} = S(f, P_{n}, t) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  where  S(f, P, t)  is a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over partition  P  and tags  t_{i} .    In a similar manner we can show that there is another set of tags  t_{i}'  for partition  P_{n}  such that  L(f, P_{n}) > S(f, P_{n}, t') - \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  We now have \\begin{align} U( f , P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n}) &= |U(f, P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &= |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t) - I + I - S(f, P_{n}, t')\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &\\leq |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t) - I|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|I - S(f, P_{n}, t')|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &< \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}\\notag\\\\ &= \\epsilon\\notag \\end{align} Therefore by criterion for Riemann integrability $f$ is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  according to the standard definition of Riemann integrability.       On the other hand the second definition suggested by OP (which fixes the tags for a given partition) does not seem amenable to an analysis like the one given in preceding paragraphs. I have not been able to figure out a counter-example to show that this definition is not equivalent to the standard definition. However it does appear that the choice of tags is essential to link the Riemann sums with upper and lower Darboux sums and this is probably an essential ingredient in the definition of Riemann integral.       Update : In the proof presented above I nowhere use the fact that  P_{n}   is a partition of specific form where all sub-intervals are of equal length. In particular we don't assume anything about norm of  P_{n}  . All  I  assume is that there is a sequence of such partitions for which the Riemann sums converge to  I . What is assumed is that the number $I$ does not depend on choice of tags, but the speed of convergence may depend on choice of tags. This will make  N  in the proof to be dependent on the choice of tags. But this is not a problem as we are dealing with only two choices of tags so that we can have  N_{1},N_{2}  in place of  N  and choose  N=\\max(N_{1},N_{2}) .

I wanted to expand on the last comment from @Arthur and a comment is too small. If I am not mistaken from my quick calculation it shows that the time needed for rolling is not the same as for sliding. Since the conservation of energy contains an additional term. Give a curve  f(x)  in case you have a particle of  m ass $m$ sliding your conservation of energy would look like this (potential energy plus kinetic one). Note I am using the notation  x(t)  for  t he function that relates the position of the particle at a specific time $t$. The time  t=0  is the starting moment and the particle is tought to start without velocity.   mgf(x(0))=mgf(x)+\\frac{1}{2}mv^2   in case you have ball of radius  R  rolling (without sliding) your conservation of energy contains a term   K=\\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2   where  \\omega  is the angular velocity.

(Equi v alently, it is the total into  v  minus the total out of $v$.) In your example, after you've pushed that one unit of flow along the top/red path, your total flow is  5  ( 6   u nits out of $u$ minus  1   u nit into  u ).    A natural question is how do you know that your current flow is maximum? For this, you need to try to find  augmenting paths.  Suppose you ha v e a path from  u  to $v$ and yo u  tra v el along that path starting at $u$. The path is called an  augmenting path  if for every edge on the path, the following hold:      If the edge's direction  agrees  with the direction you are going in, then the flow value of that edge is  not  at capacity.    If the edge's direction  goes against  your direction of travel, then that edge has a  positive  flow value on it.       A common mistake is to only look for paths from $u$ to $v$ where each edge agrees with the direction of travel. These  can  be augmenting paths (as your red path is, for example), but you also need to consider other possibilities. In your example,  (u,w,v)  is an augmenting path since edge  (u,v)  goes against your direction of travel but has positive flow value, and the edge  (w,v)  agrees with yo u r direction of tra v el but the flow value is less than capacity.     The point of an augmenting path is that you can \"push\" more flow from $u$ to $v$ along that path by some amount, where you  lessen  the flow along the edges that disagree with your direction of travel and you increase the flow along the edges that do agree with your direction. Of course you want to push as much flow as possible, and if you do this, your path will no longer be augmenting. In your example, you can push a maximum of one unit of flow along the augmenting path  (u,w,v)  and the new flow value on  (u,w)  is \" 3,(0) \" and the new flow value on edge  (w,v)  is \" 5,(2) \".    The theorem you may have seen is:        A  (u,v) -flow is maxim u m if and only if there are no augmenting paths from $u$ to  v .

First o f  all it is obvious that i f  a function $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the standard definition (the one which involves choice of partition as well as tags) then it is also Riemann integrable according to the two alternative definitions suggested by OP.    Further we know that the theory of Riemann integration is conveniently studied using Darboux sums instead of Riemann sums and in this connection we have the following result (proof is available in almost any real-analysis textbook):        Criterion for Riemann Integrability :  A function $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  if and only if for every  \\epsilon > 0  there is a partition  P_{\\epsilon}  of  [a, b]  such that  U(f, P_{\\epsilon}) - L(f, P_{\\epsilon}) < \\epsilon  where for any partition  P = \\{a = x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n} = b\\}, x_{i - 1} < x_{i}, i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n  the upper Darboux sum  f or $f$ (denoted by  U(f, P) ) and lower Darboux sum (denoted by  L(f, P) ) is given by  U(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}),\\, L(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}m_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1})  with  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\},\\,m_{i} = \\inf\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}      Using this result it is possible to prove that i f  $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the first definition suggested by OP then it is Riemann integrable according to the standard accepted definition of Riemann integrability.    Let's fix an  \\epsilon > 0 . Let  P_{n} = \\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\}  denote equipartition of  [a, b]  so that  x_{i} = a + i(b - a)/n . Let us assume that a  f unction $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable according to the first definition given by OP. Then there exists a number  I  and a positive integer  N  such that  |S(f, P_{n}) - I| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  for all  n > N . Here  S(f, P_{n})  represents a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over equipartition  P_{n}  with any arbitrary set of tags (the notation  S(f, P)  does not explicitly indicate the dependence on tags and it will be augmented later to show this dependence). The important thing to note here is that  N  depends only on  \\epsilon  and not on the choice of tags with partition  P_{n} .    In what follows let us fix a positive integer  n > N . Since  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}  it follows that there is a point  t_{i} \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]  such that  M_{i} - f(t_{i}) < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4(b - a)}  and hence  U(f,P_{n}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) < \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(t_{i})(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} = S(f, P_{n}, t) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  where  S(f, P, t)  is a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over partition  P  and tags  t_{i} .    In a similar manner we can show that there is another set of tags  t_{i}'  for partition  P_{n}  such that  L(f, P_{n}) > S(f, P_{n}, t') - \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  We now have \\begin{align} U( f , P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n}) &= |U(f, P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &= |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t) - I + I - S(f, P_{n}, t')\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &\\leq |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t) - I|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|I - S(f, P_{n}, t')|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &< \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}\\notag\\\\ &= \\epsilon\\notag \\end{align} Therefore by criterion for Riemann integrability $f$ is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  according to the standard definition of Riemann integrability.       On the other hand the second definition suggested by OP (which fixes the tags for a given partition) does not seem amenable to an analysis like the one given in preceding paragraphs. I have not been able to figure out a counter-example to show that this definition is not equivalent to the standard definition. However it does appear that the choice of tags is essential to link the Riemann sums with upper and lower Darboux sums and this is probably an essential ingredient in the definition of Riemann integral.       Update : In the proof presented above I nowhere use the fact that  P_{n}   is a partition of specific form where all sub-intervals are of equal length. In particular we don't assume anything about norm of  P_{n}  . All  I  assume is that there is a sequence of such partitions for which the Riemann sums converge to  I . What is assumed is that the number $I$ does not depend on choice of tags, but the speed of convergence may depend on choice of tags. This will make  N  in the proof to be dependent on the choice of tags. But this is not a problem as we are dealing with only two choices of tags so that we can have  N_{1},N_{2}  in place of  N  and choose  N=\\max(N_{1},N_{2}) .

The path is called an  augmenting path  if for every edge on the path, the following hold:      If the edge's direction  agrees  with the direction you are going in, then the flow value of that edge is  not  at capacity.    If the edge's direction  goes against  your direction of travel, then that edge has a  positive  flow value on it.       A common mistake is to only look for paths from $u$ to $v$ where each edge agrees with the direction of travel.

The point of an augmenting path is that you can \"push\" more flow from $u$ to $v$ along that path by some amount, where you  lessen  the flow along the edges that disagree with your direction of travel and you increase the flow along the edges that do agree with your direction. Of course you want to push as much flow as possible, and if you do this, your path will no longer be augmenting. In your example, you can push a maximum of one unit of flow along the augmenting path  (u,w,v)  and the new flow value on  (u,w)  is \" 3,(0) \" and the new flow value on edge  (w,v)  is \" 5,(2) \".

If you are in  S_1 , you go back to  S_0  with probability  (1-p)  and you go to  S_2  with  p robability $p$. If you are in  S_2 , you go back to  S_0  with probability  (1-p)  and you go to  S_3  with  p robability $p$. If you are in  S_3 , you stay there with probability  1 .    So the entire process is encoded by the transition matrix:     P=\\left(\\begin{array}{cccc}1-p & p & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1-p & 0 & p & 0 \\\\ 1-p & 0 & 0 & p\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\end{array}\\right)  that is a stochastic matrix, and the wanted probability is  (1\\,0\\,0\\,0)\\,P^{12}\\,(0\\, 0\\,0 \\, 1)^T , the probability of ending in  S_3  after  12  steps. This particular number can be computed by putting  P  into its Jordan canonical form: the Jordan base of  P^{12}  is the same as the Jordan base of  P  and the eigenvalues of  P^{12}  are just the twelfth powers of the eigenvalues of  P .

Example :    a = 2^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 101^3\\\\ b = 2^3 \\cdot 7^4 \\cdot 11    5  and  101   a ppear in $a$  b ut not in $b$, so we get  5 \\cdot 101^3 .    7  and  11  appear in  b  but not in  a , so we get  5 \\cdot 101^3 \\cdot 7^4 \\cdot 11 .    Finally, we have  2  in both factorizations. Since the greatest exponent is  3 , we get  5 \\cdot 101^3 \\cdot 7^4 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 2^3 = 2^3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7^4 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 101^3 .    Therefore, if we have  lcm(n, m) = 600 , the n  neither $n$ nor  m  can have prime factors other than  2, 3  or  5 . What is more, none of them can have  2  to a greater power than  3 ,  3  to a greater power than  1  and  5  to a greater power than  2 .    We can see that we must have the following:    n = 2^{a_1} \\cdot 3^{a_2} \\cdot 5^{a_3}\\\\ m = 2^{b_1} \\cdot 3^{b_2} \\cdot 5^{b_3}    But also, we must have the following:    \\begin{cases}\\max\\{a_1, b_1\\} = 3\\\\ \\max\\{a_2, b_2\\} = 1\\\\ \\max\\{a_3, b_3\\} = 2\\\\ 0 \\leq a_1,b_1 \\leq 3\\\\ 0 \\leq a_2, b_2 \\leq 1\\\\ 0 \\leq a_3, b_3 \\leq 2\\end{cases}    Therefore it is a simple matter of cou n ti n g. Also note that for every possible factorization of $n$, if $n$ has one of its pri m e factors to a power that is not the  m aximum needed, then $m$'s prime is determined. For example, if you are counting the possibilities for $m$ when  n = 2\\cdot3\\cdot5^2 , you know  i m mediately  that $m$ has  2^3  in its factorization and thus  m = 2^3 \\cdot 3^x \\cdot 5^y  with  x  and  y  varyi n g.    EDIT:  included final computation:    Note that if $n$ does not have any of  2^3, 3  and  5^2 , then  m  is automatically determi n ed. For those such $n$, you can pick any of  2^0, 2^1, 2^2 , then you have to pick  3^0  and you can pick  5^0  or  5^1 . Thus there are  3\\cdot1\\cdot2 = 6  such pairs where  m   must  be  600 .    The remai n i n g cases are counted by fixing what powers $n$ already has complete:      $n$ only has  2^3 . There are  2  ways to finish it (because it does not have  3  nor  5^2 .  m  has  4  possibilities for the exponent of  2  and the others are already determined. Thus there are  2\\cdot4 = 8  pairs.   n  only has  3 . There are  3\\cdot2  ways to finish it.  m  can only have  3^0  or  3^1  thus there are  6\\cdot2 = 12  such pairs.   n  only has  5^2 . There are  3\\cdot1  ways to finish it.  m  can have either  5^0  or  5^1  or  5^2  thus there are  3\\cdot2\\cdot2 = 12  such pairs.   n  has  2^3  and  3 : gives  2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 = 16  pairs.   n  has  2^3  and  5^2 : gives  1 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 = 12  pairs.   n  has  3  and  5^2 : gives  3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 18  pairs.   n  has  2^3 ,  3  and  5^2 : gives  4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 24  pairs.

We'll prove this by answering  b) , constructing a Harshad number with digit sum $n$.   First, we define  l(n)  to be  n  without its factors  2  and  5 . Examples are:  l(23)=23 ,  l(24)=3 ,  l(25)=1 . If we ca n  construct a number with digit sum $n$ that is divisible by  l(n) , the n  surely we can make it divisible by $n$ by just adding enough  0 's at the end (equivalent to multiplying it with  10  repeatedly, so this wont change the fact that it is divisible by  l(n) ). Let  A  be a set of  n  non-negative integers, that is,  A\\subseteq\\mathbb{N}_0  and  |A|=n . Now the number    \\xi=\\sum_{a\\in A}10^a    has digit sum  n ,  a nd this doesn't depend on the numbers in $a$. For it to be divisible by  l(n) , we'd need    \\xi=\\sum_{a\\in A}10^a\\equiv 0\\mod l(n)    and since  10^{\\phi(l(n))}\\equiv1\\mod l(n)  (note that we use  \\gcd(10,l(n))=1  here), we can choose    A=\\{0\\cdot\\phi(l(n)),1\\cdot\\phi(l(n)),2\\cdot\\phi(l(n)),\\cdots,(n-1)\\cdot\\phi(l(n))\\}    so that we get (all equivalences are  \\mod l(n) ): \\begin{align} \\xi&\\equiv\\sum_{a\\in A}10^a\\\\ &\\equiv\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}10^{k\\cdot\\phi(l(n))}\\\\ &\\equiv\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\\left(10^{\\phi(l(n))}\\right)^{k}\\\\ &\\equiv\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}1^{k}\\\\ &\\equiv\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}1\\\\ &\\equiv n\\\\ &\\equiv 0\\mod l(n) \\end{align} where the last,  n\\equiv0\\mod l(n) , holds since  l(n)\\mid n , because  l(n)  has the same factors as  n  and maybe a little less, but never more. Now we can append enough zeroes at the end so that it is not only divisible by  l(n) , but also by  n . To get back to your example  n=11 , we get  l(11)=11 , and  \\phi(l(n))=\\phi(11)=10 , so we get  A=\\{0,10,20,30,\\cdots,100\\} , arriving at the number        10000000001000000000100000000010000000001000000000100000000010000000001000000000100000000010000000001      and we don't need to append zeroes because  11  didn't contain any factors  2  or  5 .

Let us assume that a  f unction $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable according to the first definition given by OP. Then there exists a number  I  and a positive integer  N  such that  |S(f, P_{n}) - I| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  for all  n > N . Here  S(f, P_{n})  represents a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over equipartition  P_{n}  with any arbitrary set of tags (the notation  S(f, P)  does not explicitly indicate the dependence on tags and it will be augmented later to show this dependence). The important thing to note here is that  N  depends only on  \\epsilon  and not on the choice of tags with partition  P_{n} .    In what follows let us fix a positive integer  n > N .

In a similar manner we can show that there is another set of tags  t_{i}'  for partition  P_{n}  such that  L(f, P_{n}) > S(f, P_{n}, t') - \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  We now have \\begin{align} U( f , P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n}) &= |U(f, P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &= |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t) - I + I - S(f, P_{n}, t')\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &\\leq |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t) - I|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|I - S(f, P_{n}, t')|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &< \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}\\notag\\\\ &= \\epsilon\\notag \\end{align} Therefore by criterion for Riemann integrability $f$ is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  according to the standard definition of Riemann integrability.

Thus  g^{r+k}\\equiv g^{s+k}  for all  k .    If  g  a n d $n$ are coprime, it gets a bit simpler, because  g^k\\equiv g^{k'} \\pmod{n}  for some  k, k'  with  k>k'   implies   g^{k-k'}\\equiv 1  (you can take the modular inverse because then all  g^k  are copime to  n ), then with  r=k-k' , you have  g^{k+r}\\equiv g^kg^r\\equiv g^k  for all  k    If  g  a n d $n$ are not coprime, it's not as simple:  if   g^r \\equiv 0 \\pmod{n}  fo r  some $r$ then  g^{k+r}\\equiv g^kg^r\\equiv 0  for all  k . But you may also have a repeating sequence without any  1 , for example, modulo  15 ,    3^0\\equiv1,\\; 3^1\\equiv3,\\; 3^2\\equiv9,\\; 3^3\\equiv12,\\; 3^4\\equiv6,\\; 3^5\\equiv3\\pmod{15}    And it starts repeating after  3^4 , with numbers not coprime to  15  since  g=3  is  n ot coprime to $n$ either. And actually, if  g  a n d $n$ are not coprime, you never get a  1  again after  g^0\\equiv1 \\pmod{n} , because all  g^k  have a commo n  factor with $n$.       Alternately, the  g/wiki/Multiplicative_order\" rel=\" n oreferrer\">multiplicative order  of $g$ modulo $n$ is the smallest exponent  k  such that  g^k\\equiv 1\\pmod{n} .    Here you see that the multiplicative order of  3  modulo  7  is  6 , and the multiplicative order of  3  modulo  11  is  5 , so by your definition,  3  is indeed a primitive root modulo  7 , but not modulo  11 .    Notice also that the multiplicative order of  g  modulo a  p rime $p$ is always less or equal to  p-1 , since  p://en.wikipedi a .org/wiki/Fermat%27s_little_theorem\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Fermat's little theorem  states that for a  p rime $p$ and $a$ not divisible by $p$,  a^{p-1}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{p} . Then the multiplicative order is also always a divisor of  p-1 , and it lends to a simple al g orithm to look for primitive roots:    To test a possible $g$, take the integer factorization of  p-1 , an d  for every prime factor $d$ of  p-1 , compute  g^{(p-1)/d}  modulo  p .

Basically, there are $m$ points and $n$ wal k ers. Wal k ers pic k  points at random, one at a time without replacement, so that after round $k$ each walker has picked $k$ points at random.    If we just look at round $k$ without thinking about the sequential nature of picking points, each walker has picked $k$ points at random, independent of the other walkers.    The question we now ask is:  What is the likelihood  q_k  that whe n  $n$ wal k ers each pick $k$ out of  m  points, all points will be pic k ed by at least one wal k er?    If we can answer that question for any $k$, the likelihood that the last points were picked in round $k$ will be  p_k = q_k-q_{k-1} .    Now, let's keep the nu m ber of points, $m$, and round,  k , fixed a n d instead vary the number of walkers, $n$.    Let the random variable  X_n  be the  n umber of unpicked points when there are $n$ walkers: ie, the likelihood of  X_n=x  for some  x  is the likelihood that with  n  walkers, there will remain e x actly $x$ points not picked by any of the walkers.    If there is only one walker, obviously  X_1=m-k  (ie the likelihood of  X_1=m-k  is one) since that one wal k er has picked $k$ points and  m-k  thus remain unpic k ed.    If there are two walkers, each have picked $k$ points at rando m  out of the $m$ points, so the number of unpicked points follows a  hypergeometric distribution :  X_2\\sim\\text{Hypergeom}(m-k,m-k,m) .    If there are  n  walkers, and the first  n-1  walkers have left  X_{n-1}  poi n ts unpicked, the number of points also not picked by the $n$th walker will be   X_n \\sim \\text{Hypergeom}(X_{n-1},m-k,m)   which basically gives us a recursive expression for  X_n .    I came across this type of iterated hypergeometric distrubutions when studying  sequence shuffling , where I found these could be expressed in terms of  generalised hypergeometric series . To make a long story short,   \\text{E}\\left[ (1+u)^{X_n}\\right] =\\sum_{i=0}^{m-k}    \\frac{[(m-k)(m-k-1)\\cdots(m-k-i+1)]^n}{[m(m-1)\\cdots(m-i+1)]^{n-1}}    \\frac{u^i}{i!} =\\sum_{i=0}^{m-k}    \\frac{\\left(\\frac{(m-k)!}{(m-k-i)!}\\right)^n}     {\\left(\\frac{m!}{(m-i)!}\\right)^{n-1}} \\frac{u^i}{i!}.   I'll show how to derive this further down.    In terms of hypergeometric functions, this is   \\text{E}\\left[ (1+u)^{X_n}\\right] = {}_{n}F_{n-1}(k-m,\\ldots,k-m;-m,\\ldots,-m;-u)   where  {}_{n}F_{n-1}  takes  n  times the parameter  -(m-k)  in the numerator and  n-1  times the parameter  -m  in the denominator.    This gives the probability generating function   \\text{E}\\left[t^{X_n}\\right] = \\sum_{x=0}^m \\Pr[X_n=x]\\cdot t^x =\\sum_{i=0}^{m-k}    \\frac{\\left(\\frac{(m-k)!}{(m-k-i)!}\\right)^n}     {\\left(\\frac{m!}{(m-i)!}\\right)^{n-1}} \\frac{(t-1)^i}{i!} = {}_{n}F_{n-1}(k-m,\\ldots,k-m;-m,\\ldots,-m;1-t).     The likelihood that all points have been picked, ie  \\Pr[X_n=0] , is then found by entering  t=0 :   \\Pr[X_n=0] =\\sum_{i=0}^{m-k}    \\frac{\\left(\\frac{(m-k)!}{(m-k-i)!}\\right)^n}     {\\left(\\frac{m!}{(m-i)!}\\right)^{n-1}} \\frac{(-1)^i}{i!} = {}_{n}F_{n-1}(k-m,\\ldots,k-m;-m,\\ldots,-m;1).     Thus, give n  the $n$ wal k ers and instead varying the number of rounds, the likelihood that all points have been picked in round $k$ or earlier is   q_k = {}_{n}F_{n-1}(k-m,\\ldots,k-m;-m,\\ldots,-m;1)   which makes   p_k = q_k-q_{k-1} = {}_{n}F_{n-1}(k-m,\\ldots,k-m;-m,\\ldots,-m;1)  - {}_{n}F_{n-1}(k-1-m,\\ldots,k-1-m;-m,\\ldots,-m;1).     I recall there is quite a bit of theory about how to compute these, recursions as well as numerical methods, but don't remember all that very well. You should be able to use math packages like Maple or Mathematica to do them. Eg, typing  hypergeom([-3,-3,-3],[-5,-5],1)  into  Wolfram Alpha  gives you  q_2=9/50  for  m=5 ,  n=3 .       Derivation of the hypergeo m etric series:ng>    Given $m$ points and $n$ wal k ers, each picking $k$ points at random, let  X_k  be the numbe r  of points not picked by any walker.    For any selection of $r$ points, the likelihood that a walker has not picked any of these points is  \\binom{m-r}{k}/\\binom{m}{k} : ie the number of ways to pic k  $k$ points from the remaining  m-r  divided by the nu m ber of ways to pick them from from all $m$ poi n ts. Thus, the likelihood that none of the $n$ walke r  pick any of these $r$ points is  [\\binom{m-r}{k}/\\binom{m}{k}]^n .    Since there are  \\binom{m}{r}  diffe r ent ways to pick the  r  points, the expected number of ways to pick $r$ points which none of the walkers have selected is  \\binom{m}{r}\\cdot[\\binom{m-r}{k}/\\binom{m}{k}]^n .    Howeve r , the number of ways to pick $r$ points not picked by any of the walkers can also be expressed as  \\text{E}[\\binom{X_k}{r}] . The equality between the two means that   \\text{E}\\left[\\binom{X_k}{r}\\right] = \\binom{m}{r}\\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\binom{m-r}{k}}{\\binom{m}{k}}\\right)^n = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{(m-k)!}{(m-k-r)!}\\right)^n}     {\\left(\\frac{m!}{(m-r)!}\\right)^{n-1}}   \\cdot\\frac{1}{r!}.   This gives us the desired result:   \\text{E}\\left[(1+u)^{X_k}\\right] = \\sum_{r=0}^m \\text{E}\\left[\\binom{X_k}{r}\\right] u^r = \\sum_{r=0}^m    \\frac{\\left(\\frac{(m-k)!}{(m-k-r)!}\\right)^n}     {\\left(\\frac{m!}{(m-r)!}\\right)^{n-1}}   \\cdot\\frac{u^r}{r!}.        Computed example with  m=6  points and  n=5  walkers:    This makes:   q_1 = \\text{hypergeom}([-5,-5,-5,-5,-5],[-6,-6,-6,-6],1) = 0 \\\\ q_2 = \\text{hypergeom}([-4,-4,-4,-4,-4],[-6,-6,-6,-6],1) = 6026/16875 \\\\ q_3 = \\text{hypergeom}([-3,-3,-3,-3,-3],[-6,-6,-6,-6],1) = 130767/160000 \\\\ q_4 = \\text{hypergeom}([-2,-2,-2,-2,-2],[-6,-6,-6,-6],1) = 49376/50625 \\\\ q_5 = \\text{hypergeom}([-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],[-6,-6,-6,-6],1) = 1295/1296 \\\\ q_6 = \\text{hypergeom}([-0,-0,-0,-0,-0],[-6,-6,-6,-6],1) = 1   which gives probabilities  p_1=0 ,  p_2=6026/16875\\approx 0.357 ,  p_3=1988053/4320000\\approx 0.460 ,  p_4=2048129/12960000\\approx 0.158 ,  p_5=239/10000=0.0239 ,  p_6=1/1296\\approx 0.00077  for the likelihood  p_k  of having pic k ed all points after round $k$.

Since  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}  it follows that there is a point  t_{i} \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]  such that  M_{i} - f(t_{i}) < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4(b - a)}  and hence  U(f,P_{n}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) < \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(t_{i})(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} = S(f, P_{n}, t) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  where  S(f, P, t)  is a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over partition  P  and tags  t_{i} .    In a similar manner we can show that there is another set of tags  t_{i}'  for partition  P_{n}  such that  L(f, P_{n}) > S(f, P_{n}, t') - \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  We now have \\begin{align} U( f , P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n}) &= |U(f, P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &= |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t) - I + I - S(f, P_{n}, t')\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &\\leq |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t) - I|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|I - S(f, P_{n}, t')|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &< \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}\\notag\\\\ &= \\epsilon\\notag \\end{align} Therefore by criterion for Riemann integrability $f$ is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  according to the standard definition of Riemann integrability.       On the other hand the second definition suggested by OP (which fixes the tags for a given partition) does not seem amenable to an analysis like the one given in preceding paragraphs. I have not been able to figure out a counter-example to show that this definition is not equivalent to the standard definition. However it does appear that the choice of tags is essential to link the Riemann sums with upper and lower Darboux sums and this is probably an essential ingredient in the definition of Riemann integral.       Update : In the proof presented above I nowhere use the fact that  P_{n}   is a partition of specific form where all sub-intervals are of equal length. In particular we don't assume anything about norm of  P_{n}  . All  I  assume is that there is a sequence of such partitions for which the Riemann sums converge to  I . What is assumed is that the number $I$ does not depend on choice of tags, but the speed of convergence may depend on choice of tags. This will make  N  in the proof to be dependent on the choice of tags. But this is not a problem as we are dealing with only two choices of tags so that we can have  N_{1},N_{2}  in place of  N  and choose  N=\\max(N_{1},N_{2}) .

(Equi v alently, it is the total into  v  minus the total out of $v$.) In your example, after you've pushed that one unit of flow along the top/red path, your total flow is  5  ( 6   u nits out of $u$ minus  1   u nit into  u ).    A natural question is how do you know that your current flow is maximum? For this, you need to try to find  augmenting paths.  Suppose you ha v e a path from  u  to $v$ and yo u  tra v el along that path starting at $u$. The path is called an  augmenting path  if for every edge on the path, the following hold:      If the edge's direction  agrees  with the direction you are going in, then the flow value of that edge is  not  at capacity.    If the edge's direction  goes against  your direction of travel, then that edge has a  positive  flow value on it.       A common mistake is to only look for paths from $u$ to $v$ where each edge agrees with the direction of travel. These  can  be augmenting paths (as your red path is, for example), but you also need to consider other possibilities. In your example,  (u,w,v)  is an augmenting path since edge  (u,v)  goes against your direction of travel but has positive flow value, and the edge  (w,v)  agrees with yo u r direction of tra v el but the flow value is less than capacity.     The point of an augmenting path is that you can \"push\" more flow from $u$ to $v$ along that path by some amount, where you  lessen  the flow along the edges that disagree with your direction of travel and you increase the flow along the edges that do agree with your direction. Of course you want to push as much flow as possible, and if you do this, your path will no longer be augmenting. In your example, you can push a maximum of one unit of flow along the augmenting path  (u,w,v)  and the new flow value on  (u,w)  is \" 3,(0) \" and the new flow value on edge  (w,v)  is \" 5,(2) \".    The theorem you may have seen is:        A  (u,v) -flow is maxim u m if and only if there are no augmenting paths from $u$ to  v .

Here, what you basically do is move a fixed distance $d$ along the normal line at each point of the initial curve (your  g(x) ) to obtain the correspondin g  point on the parallel curve. This can be calculated based on the derivative of $g$, as the slope of the normal line is related to that of the tangent line (they differ by 90 degrees, or  \\pi / 2  ra d ians). What you have done is to replace the constant $d$ with a  f unction $f$ of the same  x  as used in in  g , hence the distance is now also a function of where you are on the  g  function (so now,  d=f(x) ).

If you try it out, you should find that  P(5)   is  true.

According to the binomial theorem, the left-hand side of this equation is the product of two factors, both equal to    $\\binom{n}{0}1+\\binom{n}{1}x+...+\\binom{n}{r}x^r+...+\\binom{n}{n}x^n$    When both factors multiply, a term on  $x^n$  is obtained when a term of the first factor has some  $x^i$  and the term of the second factor has some  $x^{n-i}$ . Therefor the coefficients of  $x^n$  are    $\\binom{n}{0}\\binom{n}{n}+\\binom{n}{1}\\binom{n}{n-1}+\\binom{n}{2}\\binom{n}{n-2}+...\\binom{n}{n}\\binom{n}{0}$  .    Since  $\\binom{n}{n-r}=\\binom{n}{r}$ , the previous summation is equal to  $\\binom{n}{0}^2 + \\binom{n}{1}^2 + ... + \\binom{n}{n}^2$ . So the left hand side of the equation we are asked to proove is a coefficient of  $x^n$ . When we expand the right-hand side of the equation  $P$ , we find that  $\\binom{2n}{n}$  is a coefficient of  $x^n$ . Therefore  (?-3)  the left-hand side of the equation we were asked to prove is in deed equal to  $\\binom{2n}{n}$ . In conclussion,    $\\binom{n}{0}^2 + \\binom{n}{1}^2 + ... + \\binom{n}{n}^2 = \\binom{2n}{n}$ .    This was all the demonstration. My doubt one  (?-1)  goes about where the heck does this equation come from? How would I know what equation to come up with if requested to prove a different equality?    Doubt two  (?-2)  goes about why would the solution of the first equation would have anything to do with finding the  $x^n$  coefficients of the one I just made up (see doubt one).    Doubt three  (?-3)  goes about why demonstrating that  $a$  is a coefficient of  $x^n$  on the left hand side of the equation I made up, and that  $b$  is a coefficient of  $x^n$  on the right-hand side of this equation as well, would prove my original equation, the one I was supposed to prove on the first place?    I know there are many doubts here, I hope you guys can help me. Sorry for the long post, it's a long demonstration.

The reason is that one can reduce the halting problem for Turing machines to the question of whether a certain term generates another with respect to a certain system.     The idea of the proof is to use terms to represent the configuration of a Turing machine computation. For example, the term  a(b(H_s(c(b(a(.))))))  would represent the Turing machine having tape  abcba , with the head on the \"c\" in  s tate $s$. Now, you write down term rewrite rules that correspond to the steps of computation, so that  b(H_s(c(t)))\\to H_u(b(a(t))  would be a rule, where  t  is a wild c ard for any further  s ubterm, if the Turing m a c hine was s u pposed  t o move left when reading symbol $c$ in state $s$, writing $a$ over the $c$ and changing to state $u$. If you also add rules that if a halt state is achieved, then the terms begin to absorb their arguments and containing terms into a constant \"halt\" term. Thus, the system has the property that the given Turing machine halts if and only if we can generate this \"halt\" term from the term corresponding to the initial configuration of the machine. Since we cannot decide the halting problem, it now follows that we cannot decide the generation problem for this term rewrite system.    Notice that the type of rules I used in this argument are somewhat more complicated than the example rules in your question. For example, in the Turing machine computation step, we have preserved the (unknown) subterm $t$. So this argument applies only to systems in which such rules are allowed.    This kind of rewrite system is somewhat easier to think about in terms of strings, with rewrite rules about substrings, and this is known as a  semi-Thue system . I also wrote  this MathOverflow answer  on the same topic, showing that the special case where the terms on each side of the rewrite rules have the same length is decidable, but NP-hard.     Lastly, I would like to object to the  \"congruent\" terminology, since I find that word to suggest a symmetric relation, but the term-rewrite-generation relation is not generally symmetric, unless you allow the rules to be applied backwards.

Examples are:  l(23)=23 ,  l(24)=3 ,  l(25)=1 . If we ca n  construct a number with digit sum $n$ that is divisible by  l(n) , the n  surely we can make it divisible by $n$ by just adding enough  0 's at the end (equivalent to multiplying it with  10  repeatedly, so this wont change the fact that it is divisible by  l(n) ).

Now the number    \\xi=\\sum_{a\\in A}10^a    has digit sum  n ,  a nd this doesn't depend on the numbers in $a$.

A natural question is how do you know that your current flow is maximum? For this, you need to try to find  augmenting paths.  Suppose you ha v e a path from  u  to $v$ and yo u  tra v el along that path starting at $u$. The path is called an  augmenting path  if for every edge on the path, the following hold:      If the edge's direction  agrees  with the direction you are going in, then the flow value of that edge is  not  at capacity.    If the edge's direction  goes against  your direction of travel, then that edge has a  positive  flow value on it.       A common mistake is to only look for paths from $u$ to $v$ where each edge agrees with the direction of travel. These  can  be augmenting paths (as your red path is, for example), but you also need to consider other possibilities. In your example,  (u,w,v)  is an augmenting path since edge  (u,v)  goes against your direction of travel but has positive flow value, and the edge  (w,v)  agrees with yo u r direction of tra v el but the flow value is less than capacity.     The point of an augmenting path is that you can \"push\" more flow from $u$ to $v$ along that path by some amount, where you  lessen  the flow along the edges that disagree with your direction of travel and you increase the flow along the edges that do agree with your direction. Of course you want to push as much flow as possible, and if you do this, your path will no longer be augmenting. In your example, you can push a maximum of one unit of flow along the augmenting path  (u,w,v)  and the new flow value on  (u,w)  is \" 3,(0) \" and the new flow value on edge  (w,v)  is \" 5,(2) \".

First, note that the notion of an inner automorphism is not universal in the sense that any automorphism $u$ of a group  G , can be considered as inner in a larger group (consider for instance the semi-direct product of  G  and  u ).    Now working with a fixed group  G , some of the propeties of the inner automorphisms (unfortunately, shared with other automorphisms) is that they act trivially on the center, they preserve conjugacy classes and act trivially on  G/G' .  However, these facts are in general so vague to decide whether an automorphism is inner or not.    A more powerful method is using cohomology (is some cases), for instance if our group contains a self centralizing normal subgroup  N , one has an isomorphism between the group of  1 -cocycles  Z^1(G/N, Z(N))  and the group of automorphisms acting trivially on  G/Z(N)  and  N , and this isomorphism maps the subgroup of  1 -cobords exactely to the group of inner automorphisms acting trivially on  G/Z(N)  and  N .  So, the problem of having a non inner automorphism in this class amounts to proving that the cohomology group  H^1(G/N, Z(N))  is not trivial.  This interesting relation was used by Gaschutz in proving his famous result, that every finite non-simple p-group has outer automorphisms.    Finally, I note that there is many outstanding problems related to deciding that some automorphisms are inner or not, and the existing tools seem to be very unsatisfactory.

Logarithms are also really helpful in the way that J.M. suggested in the comment to your question: getting minute quantities to a more usable scale.     A good example: probabilities.     In tasks such as speech-to-text programs and many other language-related computational problems, you deal with strings of elements (such as sentences composed of words) where each has an associated probability (numbers between 0 and 1, often near zero, such as  0.00763 ,  0.034  and  0.000069 ). To get the total probability over all such elements, i.e. the whole sentence, the individual probabilities are all multiplicated: for example  0.00763 * 0.034 * 0.000069 , which yields  0.00000001789998 . Those numbers would soon get too small for computers to handle easily, given that you want to use normal 32-bit precision (and even double precision does have its limits and you never know exactly how small the probabilites might get!) If that happens, the results become inaccurate and might even be rounded down to zero, which means that the whole calculation is lost.    However, if you  \u2013log-transform  those numbers, you get two important advantages:      the numbers stay in a range which is easily expressed in 32-bit floating point numbers;   you can simply add the logarithmic values, which is the same as multiplying the original values, and addition is much faster in terms of processing time than multiplication.

First of all, (as pointed out in comments) the knight can get everywhere iff it can get from  (0, 0)  to  (1, 0) : obviously if it can reach all squares then it can reach any particular square.  Contrariwise, if it can reach  (1, 0)  then by symmetry it can reach  (0, 1)  and then by co m posi n g the move sequences $m$ and $n$ times respectively then it can get to  (m, n)  for any  m  a n d $n$.    Now, note that we can restrict to half of the available moves if we're willing to talk about both positive  and  negative move counts; we never need moves of the form  (x, y)\\to (x+a, y+b)  and  (x, y)\\to (x-a, y-b)  in the same sequence (since we could get to the same location by omitting both moves), so we can just talk about  \\alpha (+a, +b)  moves with the caveat that  \\alpha  can be negative.  For concreteness' sake, we'll limit to the four classes of moves  (\\pm a, +b)  and  (\\pm b, +a) , and use the variables  \\alpha_+ ,  \\alpha_- ,  \\beta_+ ,  \\beta_-  for the number of moves of the four types.

First o f  all it is obvious that i f  a function $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the standard definition (the one which involves choice of partition as well as tags) then it is also Riemann integrable according to the two alternative definitions suggested by OP.    Further we know that the theory of Riemann integration is conveniently studied using Darboux sums instead of Riemann sums and in this connection we have the following result (proof is available in almost any real-analysis textbook):        Criterion for Riemann Integrability :  A function $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  if and only if for every  \\epsilon > 0  there is a partition  P_{\\epsilon}  of  [a, b]  such that  U(f, P_{\\epsilon}) - L(f, P_{\\epsilon}) < \\epsilon  where for any partition  P = \\{a = x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n} = b\\}, x_{i - 1} < x_{i}, i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n  the upper Darboux sum  f or $f$ (denoted by  U(f, P) ) and lower Darboux sum (denoted by  L(f, P) ) is given by  U(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}),\\, L(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}m_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1})  with  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\},\\,m_{i} = \\inf\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}      Using this result it is possible to prove that i f  $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the first definition suggested by OP then it is Riemann integrable according to the standard accepted definition of Riemann integrability.    Let's fix an  \\epsilon > 0 . Let  P_{n} = \\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\}  denote equipartition of  [a, b]  so that  x_{i} = a + i(b - a)/n . Let us assume that a  f unction $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable according to the first definition given by OP. Then there exists a number  I  and a positive integer  N  such that  |S(f, P_{n}) - I| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  for all  n > N . Here  S(f, P_{n})  represents a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over equipartition  P_{n}  with any arbitrary set of tags (the notation  S(f, P)  does not explicitly indicate the dependence on tags and it will be augmented later to show this dependence). The important thing to note here is that  N  depends only on  \\epsilon  and not on the choice of tags with partition  P_{n} .    In what follows let us fix a positive integer  n > N . Since  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}  it follows that there is a point  t_{i} \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]  such that  M_{i} - f(t_{i}) < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4(b - a)}  and hence  U(f,P_{n}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) < \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(t_{i})(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} = S(f, P_{n}, t) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  where  S(f, P, t)  is a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over partition  P  and tags  t_{i} .    In a similar manner we can show that there is another set of tags  t_{i}'  for partition  P_{n}  such that  L(f, P_{n}) > S(f, P_{n}, t') - \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  We now have \\begin{align} U( f , P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n}) &= |U(f, P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &= |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t) - I + I - S(f, P_{n}, t')\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &\\leq |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t) - I|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|I - S(f, P_{n}, t')|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &< \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}\\notag\\\\ &= \\epsilon\\notag \\end{align} Therefore by criterion for Riemann integrability $f$ is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  according to the standard definition of Riemann integrability.       On the other hand the second definition suggested by OP (which fixes the tags for a given partition) does not seem amenable to an analysis like the one given in preceding paragraphs. I have not been able to figure out a counter-example to show that this definition is not equivalent to the standard definition. However it does appear that the choice of tags is essential to link the Riemann sums with upper and lower Darboux sums and this is probably an essential ingredient in the definition of Riemann integral.       Update : In the proof presented above I nowhere use the fact that  P_{n}   is a partition of specific form where all sub-intervals are of equal length. In particular we don't assume anything about norm of  P_{n}  . All  I  assume is that there is a sequence of such partitions for which the Riemann sums converge to  I . What is assumed is that the number $I$ does not depend on choice of tags, but the speed of convergence may depend on choice of tags. This will make  N  in the proof to be dependent on the choice of tags. But this is not a problem as we are dealing with only two choices of tags so that we can have  N_{1},N_{2}  in place of  N  and choose  N=\\max(N_{1},N_{2}) .

First o f  all it is obvious that i f  a function $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the standard definition (the one which involves choice of partition as well as tags) then it is also Riemann integrable according to the two alternative definitions suggested by OP.    Further we know that the theory of Riemann integration is conveniently studied using Darboux sums instead of Riemann sums and in this connection we have the following result (proof is available in almost any real-analysis textbook):        Criterion for Riemann Integrability :  A function $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  if and only if for every  \\epsilon > 0  there is a partition  P_{\\epsilon}  of  [a, b]  such that  U(f, P_{\\epsilon}) - L(f, P_{\\epsilon}) < \\epsilon  where for any partition  P = \\{a = x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n} = b\\}, x_{i - 1} < x_{i}, i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n  the upper Darboux sum  f or $f$ (denoted by  U(f, P) ) and lower Darboux sum (denoted by  L(f, P) ) is given by  U(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}),\\, L(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}m_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1})  with  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\},\\,m_{i} = \\inf\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}      Using this result it is possible to prove that i f  $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the first definition suggested by OP then it is Riemann integrable according to the standard accepted definition of Riemann integrability.    Let's fix an  \\epsilon > 0 . Let  P_{n} = \\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\}  denote equipartition of  [a, b]  so that  x_{i} = a + i(b - a)/n . Let us assume that a  f unction $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable according to the first definition given by OP. Then there exists a number  I  and a positive integer  N  such that  |S(f, P_{n}) - I| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  for all  n > N . Here  S(f, P_{n})  represents a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over equipartition  P_{n}  with any arbitrary set of tags (the notation  S(f, P)  does not explicitly indicate the dependence on tags and it will be augmented later to show this dependence). The important thing to note here is that  N  depends only on  \\epsilon  and not on the choice of tags with partition  P_{n} .    In what follows let us fix a positive integer  n > N . Since  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}  it follows that there is a point  t_{i} \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]  such that  M_{i} - f(t_{i}) < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4(b - a)}  and hence  U(f,P_{n}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) < \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(t_{i})(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} = S(f, P_{n}, t) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  where  S(f, P, t)  is a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over partition  P  and tags  t_{i} .    In a similar manner we can show that there is another set of tags  t_{i}'  for partition  P_{n}  such that  L(f, P_{n}) > S(f, P_{n}, t') - \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  We now have \\begin{align} U( f , P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n}) &= |U(f, P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &= |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t) - I + I - S(f, P_{n}, t')\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &\\leq |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t) - I|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|I - S(f, P_{n}, t')|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &< \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}\\notag\\\\ &= \\epsilon\\notag \\end{align} Therefore by criterion for Riemann integrability $f$ is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  according to the standard definition of Riemann integrability.       On the other hand the second definition suggested by OP (which fixes the tags for a given partition) does not seem amenable to an analysis like the one given in preceding paragraphs. I have not been able to figure out a counter-example to show that this definition is not equivalent to the standard definition. However it does appear that the choice of tags is essential to link the Riemann sums with upper and lower Darboux sums and this is probably an essential ingredient in the definition of Riemann integral.       Update : In the proof presented above I nowhere use the fact that  P_{n}   is a partition of specific form where all sub-intervals are of equal length. In particular we don't assume anything about norm of  P_{n}  . All  I  assume is that there is a sequence of such partitions for which the Riemann sums converge to  I . What is assumed is that the number $I$ does not depend on choice of tags, but the speed of convergence may depend on choice of tags. This will make  N  in the proof to be dependent on the choice of tags. But this is not a problem as we are dealing with only two choices of tags so that we can have  N_{1},N_{2}  in place of  N  and choose  N=\\max(N_{1},N_{2}) .

I wanted to expand on the last comment from @Arthur and a comment is too small. If I am not mistaken from my quick calculation it shows that the time needed for rolling is not the same as for sliding. Since the conservation of energy contains an additional term. Give a curve  f(x)  in case you have a particle of  m ass $m$ sliding your conservation of energy would look like this (potential energy plus kinetic one). Note I am using the notation  x(t)  for  t he function that relates the position of the particle at a specific time $t$. The time  t=0  is the starting moment and the particle is tought to start without velocity.   mgf(x(0))=mgf(x)+\\frac{1}{2}mv^2   in case you have ball of radius  R  rolling (without sliding) your conservation of energy contains a term   K=\\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2   where  \\omega  is the angular velocity.

So first I'd like to remark on your original question about general systems of polynomial equations. In the comments I said solving your system is relatively easy because it concerns only polynomials of low degree (in fact it it reduces to a system of equations of degree at most  2 ). In spite of my unpleasantly long and cumbersome answer I stand by this comment; in general, solving systems with (many) polynomials of higher degrees is a very ad hoc matter, and is more often than not practically intractible.       In finding all solutions I'll assume familiarity with basic linear algebra; some vector and matrix notation, and solving systems of linear equations. Let  {\\bf1}_n=(1,1,\\ldots,1)\\in\\Bbb{R}^n , let  K_i':=\\tfrac{K_i}{f}  and define  x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4\\in\\Bbb{R}^n  as  x_j:=(x_{ij})_{1\\leq i\\leq n}.  This allows us to write down the system of six equations more concisely and transparently. Rewriting a bit and substituting the first two equations into the last three, the system becomes \\begin{eqnarray*} \\langle x_4,{\\bf1}\\rangle&=&K_1',\\\\ \\langle x_2,x_3\\rangle&=&K_2',\\\\ \\langle x_1,x_3\\rangle&=&K_3',\\\\ p_{z1}K_2'+p_{y1} x_{13} \\langle x_1,{\\bf1}_n\\rangle&=&K_4',\\\\ p_{z1}K_1'+p_{x1}x_{13}\\langle x_1,{\\bf1}_n\\rangle&=&K_5',\\\\ p_{y1}K_1'+p_{z1}x_{13}\\langle x_1,{\\bf1}_n\\rangle&=&-K_6'. \\end{eqnarray*} What is most striking is that, apart from the coefficient $x_{13}$ in the last three equations, these equations concern the  x_j  only in terms of inner products! Also note that the variables  x_{24},\\ldots,x_{n4}  appear only in the first equation, which is linear and hence easy to solve. So will omit the first equation from now on.    First we treat some boundary cases. If  x_{14}=\\pm1  then  x_3=0  and the system of equations becomes \\begin{eqnarray*} 0&=&K_2',\\\\ 0&=&K_3',\\\\ 0&=&K_4',\\\\ p_{z1}K_1'&=&K_5',\\\\ p_{y1}K_1'&=&-K_6'. \\end{eqnarray*} This is a linear system of equations, having solutions (with  x_{14}=\\pm1 ) if and only if if  K_i'=0  for all  i , or  K_2'=K_3'=K_4'=0  and  K_1'\\neq0 . Similarly, if  x_{12}=\\pm1  then  x_1=0  and the system of equations becomes \\begin{eqnarray*} \\langle x_2,x_3\\rangle&=&K_2',\\\\ 0&=&K_3',\\\\ p_{z1}K_2'&=&K_4',\\\\ p_{z1}K_1'&=&K_5',\\\\ p_{y1}K_1'&=&-K_6'. \\end{eqnarray*} For any choice of  x_{22},\\ldots,x_{n2}\\in\\Bbb{R}  this is again a linear system. There are no solutions (with  x_{12}=\\pm1 ) if and only if  K_1'K_4'\\neq K_2'K_5' , or  K_2'=0  and  K_4'\\neq0 , or  K_1'=0  and  K_5'\\neq0  or  K_6'\\neq0 .    Now let  x_{12},x_{14}\\in(-1,1) . It follows from the c i rcularity equations that for all $i$  x_{i1}=\\pm\\sqrt{1-x_{12}^2}\\qquad\\text{ and }\\qquad x_{i3}=\\pm\\sqrt{1-x_{14}^2}.  Hence  x_{i1}=\\pm x_{11}  and  x_{i3}=\\pm x_{13}  for all  i , so there exist unique vectors  e_1,e_3\\in\\Bbb{R}^n  satisfying  x_1=\\sqrt{1-x_{12}^2}\\ e_1\\qquad\\text{ and }\\qquad x_3=\\sqrt{1-x_{14}^2}\\ e_3,  and all their coefficients are either  1  or  -1 . We may now rewrite the equations as \\begin{eqnarray*} \\sqrt{1-x_{14}^2}\\langle x_2,e_3\\rangle&=&K_2',\\\\ \\sqrt{1-x_{14}^2}\\sqrt{1-x_{12}^2}\\langle e_1,e_3\\rangle&=&K_3',\\\\ p_{z1}K_2'+p_{y1}e_{13}\\sqrt{1-x_{12}^2}\\sqrt{1-x_{14}^2}\\langle e_1,{\\bf1}_n\\rangle&=&K_4',\\\\ p_{z1}K_1'+p_{x1}e_{13}\\sqrt{1-x_{12}^2}\\sqrt{1-x_{14}^2}\\langle e_1,{\\bf1}_n\\rangle&=&K_5',\\\\ p_{y1}K_1'+p_{z1}e_{13}\\sqrt{1-x_{12}^2}\\sqrt{1-x_{14}^2}\\langle e_1,{\\bf1}_n\\rangle&=&-K_6'. \\end{eqnarray*} This eliminates  x_1  and  x_3  and leaves only  e_1 ,  e_3  in stead in these equations. First consider the case that  m:=\\langle e_1,e_3\\rangle\\neq0 . Then by the second equation we have  K_3'\\neq0 , and it can be written as  \\sqrt{1-x_{14}^2}\\sqrt{1-x_{12}^2}=\\frac{K_3'}{m},  which shows that we must have  \\tfrac{K_3'}{m}\\in[-1,1] , or equivalently  |K_3'|"}, "2386177": {"rank": 7, "cosine_sim_score": 1.0000004768371582, "body": "Hint: take a circular contour just inside the disk, and use the Argument Principle.

Can we find a principal ideal  $I = (P(X,Y))$  for some irreducible polynomial  $P$  that is a maximal ideal ?        Such a polynomial  $P$  must have positive degrees in both  $X$  and  $Y$ .

Moreover, such a polynomial  $P$  must have the form   $$P(X,Y) = \\sum_{i=0}^n P_i(X)Y^i$$  where  $d\\geq 1$ , the  $P_i$ 's are polynomials in  $X$  and  $P_n$  is a nonzero polynomial that vanishes identically on  $\\mathbb F_q$ , thus  $P_n$  must be divisible by  $\\prod_{\\alpha \\in \\mathbb F_q} (X-\\alpha)$ .

Further we know that the theory of Riemann integration is conveniently studied using Darboux sums instead of Riemann sums and in this connection we have the following result (proof is available in almost any real-analysis textbook):        Criterion for Riemann Integrability :  A function $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  if and only if for every  \\epsilon > 0  there is a partition  P_{\\epsilon}  of  [a, b]  such that  U(f, P_{\\epsilon}) - L(f, P_{\\epsilon}) < \\epsilon  where for any partition  P = \\{a = x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n} = b\\}, x_{i - 1} < x_{i}, i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n  the upper Darboux sum  f or $f$ (denoted by  U(f, P) ) and lower Darboux sum (denoted by  L(f, P) ) is given by  U(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}),\\, L(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}m_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1})  with  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\},\\,m_{i} = \\inf\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}      Using this result it is possible to prove that i f  $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the first definition suggested by OP then it is Riemann integrable according to the standard accepted definition of Riemann integrability.    Let's fix an  \\epsilon > 0 . Let  P_{n} = \\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\}  denote equipartition of  [a, b]  so that  x_{i} = a + i(b - a)/n . Let us assume that a  f unction $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable according to the first definition given by OP. Then there exists a number  I  and a positive integer  N  such that  |S(f, P_{n}) - I| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  for all  n > N . Here  S(f, P_{n})  represents a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over equipartition  P_{n}  with any arbitrary set of tags (the notation  S(f, P)  does not explicitly indicate the dependence on tags and it will be augmented later to show this dependence). The important thing to note here is that  N  depends only on  \\epsilon  and not on the choice of tags with partition  P_{n} .    In what follows let us fix a positive integer  n > N . Since  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}  it follows that there is a point  t_{i} \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]  such that  M_{i} - f(t_{i}) < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4(b - a)}  and hence  U(f,P_{n}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) < \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(t_{i})(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} = S(f, P_{n}, t) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  where  S(f, P, t)  is a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over partition  P  and tags  t_{i} .    In a similar manner we can show that there is another set of tags  t_{i}'  for partition  P_{n}  such that  L(f, P_{n}) > S(f, P_{n}, t') - \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  We now have \\begin{align} U( f , P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n}) &= |U(f, P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &= |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t) - I + I - S(f, P_{n}, t')\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &\\leq |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t) - I|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|I - S(f, P_{n}, t')|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &< \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}\\notag\\\\ &= \\epsilon\\notag \\end{align} Therefore by criterion for Riemann integrability $f$ is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  according to the standard definition of Riemann integrability.       On the other hand the second definition suggested by OP (which fixes the tags for a given partition) does not seem amenable to an analysis like the one given in preceding paragraphs. I have not been able to figure out a counter-example to show that this definition is not equivalent to the standard definition. However it does appear that the choice of tags is essential to link the Riemann sums with upper and lower Darboux sums and this is probably an essential ingredient in the definition of Riemann integral.       Update : In the proof presented above I nowhere use the fact that  P_{n}   is a partition of specific form where all sub-intervals are of equal length. In particular we don't assume anything about norm of  P_{n}  . All  I  assume is that there is a sequence of such partitions for which the Riemann sums converge to  I . What is assumed is that the number $I$ does not depend on choice of tags, but the speed of convergence may depend on choice of tags. This will make  N  in the proof to be dependent on the choice of tags. But this is not a problem as we are dealing with only two choices of tags so that we can have  N_{1},N_{2}  in place of  N  and choose  N=\\max(N_{1},N_{2}) .

A natural question is how do you know that your current flow is maximum? For this, you need to try to find  augmenting paths.  Suppose you ha v e a path from  u  to $v$ and yo u  tra v el along that path starting at $u$. The path is called an  augmenting path  if for every edge on the path, the following hold:      If the edge's direction  agrees  with the direction you are going in, then the flow value of that edge is  not  at capacity.    If the edge's direction  goes against  your direction of travel, then that edge has a  positive  flow value on it.       A common mistake is to only look for paths from $u$ to $v$ where each edge agrees with the direction of travel. These  can  be augmenting paths (as your red path is, for example), but you also need to consider other possibilities. In your example,  (u,w,v)  is an augmenting path since edge  (u,v)  goes against your direction of travel but has positive flow value, and the edge  (w,v)  agrees with yo u r direction of tra v el but the flow value is less than capacity.     The point of an augmenting path is that you can \"push\" more flow from $u$ to $v$ along that path by some amount, where you  lessen  the flow along the edges that disagree with your direction of travel and you increase the flow along the edges that do agree with your direction. Of course you want to push as much flow as possible, and if you do this, your path will no longer be augmenting. In your example, you can push a maximum of one unit of flow along the augmenting path  (u,w,v)  and the new flow value on  (u,w)  is \" 3,(0) \" and the new flow value on edge  (w,v)  is \" 5,(2) \".    The theorem you may have seen is:        A  (u,v) -flow is maxim u m if and only if there are no augmenting paths from $u$ to  v .

Take a look at these Venn diagrams.                The FTA allows you to think of a number as just a collection of prime numbers. Above, I've drawn Venn diagrams representing the numbers  a,b,c  an d  $d$ as sets of primes. Operations like gcd and multiplication (and others, like lcm and division) then correspond to set theoretic operations like unions and intersections. I won't prove anything I say below, I'll let you think about it for yourself.    When you multiply two numbers, you take the union of those two collections. For example,  4=2\\cdot2  and  15=3\\cdot5 , thus  4\\cdot15=2\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot5 . Thus, in diagrams (2) and (3) above, the product  ac  corresponds to the union of the regions  a  and  c .    The GCD of two numbers is similar to the  intersection  of the two corresponding sets. For example,  60=5\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot2  and  24=3\\cdot2\\cdot2\\cdot2 , so the GCD is equal to  3\\cdot2\\cdot2 . We take the largest possible collection of prime numbers that is inside  both  of the numbers  60  and  24 . Thus, in the first diagram above, I've represented the gcds of the various numbers as their intersections.    You'll notice that  a, b  and  d, c  have no intersections. This is because  \\gcd(a, b)=\\gcd(c, d)=1 . To say that two numbers have a gcd of  1  is to say that the intersection of the corresponding two lists of prime numbers is empty.    Now, we can bring all of this together to prove what we wanted to prove. Look at the last diagram. The blue region is equal to the union (ie, product) of  \\gcd(a, d)  and  \\gcd(b, c) . But it's also equal to the intersection (ie, gc) of  ac  and  db , the red and green regions from the other two diagrams. Thus, those two numbers are equal.

First o f  all it is obvious that i f  a function $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the standard definition (the one which involves choice of partition as well as tags) then it is also Riemann integrable according to the two alternative definitions suggested by OP.    Further we know that the theory of Riemann integration is conveniently studied using Darboux sums instead of Riemann sums and in this connection we have the following result (proof is available in almost any real-analysis textbook):        Criterion for Riemann Integrability :  A function $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  if and only if for every  \\epsilon > 0  there is a partition  P_{\\epsilon}  of  [a, b]  such that  U(f, P_{\\epsilon}) - L(f, P_{\\epsilon}) < \\epsilon  where for any partition  P = \\{a = x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n} = b\\}, x_{i - 1} < x_{i}, i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n  the upper Darboux sum  f or $f$ (denoted by  U(f, P) ) and lower Darboux sum (denoted by  L(f, P) ) is given by  U(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}),\\, L(f, P) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}m_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1})  with  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\},\\,m_{i} = \\inf\\,\\{f(x), x\\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}      Using this result it is possible to prove that i f  $f$ is Riemann integrable according to the first definition suggested by OP then it is Riemann integrable according to the standard accepted definition of Riemann integrability.    Let's fix an  \\epsilon > 0 . Let  P_{n} = \\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\}  denote equipartition of  [a, b]  so that  x_{i} = a + i(b - a)/n . Let us assume that a  f unction $f$ defined and bounded on  [a, b]  is Riemann integrable according to the first definition given by OP. Then there exists a number  I  and a positive integer  N  such that  |S(f, P_{n}) - I| < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  for all  n > N . Here  S(f, P_{n})  represents a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over equipartition  P_{n}  with any arbitrary set of tags (the notation  S(f, P)  does not explicitly indicate the dependence on tags and it will be augmented later to show this dependence). The important thing to note here is that  N  depends only on  \\epsilon  and not on the choice of tags with partition  P_{n} .    In what follows let us fix a positive integer  n > N . Since  M_{i} = \\sup\\,\\{f(x), x \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]\\}  it follows that there is a point  t_{i} \\in [x_{i - 1}, x_{i}]  such that  M_{i} - f(t_{i}) < \\frac{\\epsilon}{4(b - a)}  and hence  U(f,P_{n}) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}M_{i}(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) < \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}f(t_{i})(x_{i} - x_{i - 1}) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} = S(f, P_{n}, t) + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  where  S(f, P, t)  is a Riemann sum  f or $f$ over partition  P  and tags  t_{i} .    In a similar manner we can show that there is another set of tags  t_{i}'  for partition  P_{n}  such that  L(f, P_{n}) > S(f, P_{n}, t') - \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}  We now have \\begin{align} U( f , P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n}) &= |U(f, P_{n}) - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &= |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t) - I + I - S(f, P_{n}, t')\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, + S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &\\leq |U(f, P_{n}) - S(f, P_{n}, t)|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t) - I|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|I - S(f, P_{n}, t')|\\notag\\\\ &\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,+|S(f, P_{n}, t') - L(f, P_{n})|\\notag\\\\ &< \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{4}\\notag\\\\ &= \\epsilon\\notag \\end{align} Therefore by criterion for Riemann integrability $f$ is Riemann integrable on  [a, b]  according to the standard definition of Riemann integrability.       On the other hand the second definition suggested by OP (which fixes the tags for a given partition) does not seem amenable to an analysis like the one given in preceding paragraphs. I have not been able to figure out a counter-example to show that this definition is not equivalent to the standard definition. However it does appear that the choice of tags is essential to link the Riemann sums with upper and lower Darboux sums and this is probably an essential ingredient in the definition of Riemann integral.       Update : In the proof presented above I nowhere use the fact that  P_{n}   is a partition of specific form where all sub-intervals are of equal length. In particular we don't assume anything about norm of  P_{n}  . All  I  assume is that there is a sequence of such partitions for which the Riemann sums converge to  I . What is assumed is that the number $I$ does not depend on choice of tags, but the speed of convergence may depend on choice of tags. This will make  N  in the proof to be dependent on the choice of tags. But this is not a problem as we are dealing with only two choices of tags so that we can have  N_{1},N_{2}  in place of  N  and choose  N=\\max(N_{1},N_{2}) .

First, note that the notion of an inner automorphism is not universal in the sense that any automorphism $u$ of a group  G , can be considered as inner in a larger group (consider for instance the semi-direct product of  G  and  u ).    Now working with a fixed group  G , some of the propeties of the inner automorphisms (unfortunately, shared with other automorphisms) is that they act trivially on the center, they preserve conjugacy classes and act trivially on  G/G' .  However, these facts are in general so vague to decide whether an automorphism is inner or not.    A more powerful method is using cohomology (is some cases), for instance if our group contains a self centralizing normal subgroup  N , one has an isomorphism between the group of  1 -cocycles  Z^1(G/N, Z(N))  and the group of automorphisms acting trivially on  G/Z(N)  and  N , and this isomorphism maps the subgroup of  1 -cobords exactely to the group of inner automorphisms acting trivially on  G/Z(N)  and  N .  So, the problem of having a non inner automorphism in this class amounts to proving that the cohomology group  H^1(G/N, Z(N))  is not trivial.  This interesting relation was used by Gaschutz in proving his famous result, that every finite non-simple p-group has outer automorphisms.
