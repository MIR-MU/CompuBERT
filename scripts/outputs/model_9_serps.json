Let  G  be a finite group of order  n=p^rm  where  m \\nshortmid p .        It seems that there is a mistake here one should read  p \\nshortmid m  or  gcd(p,m)=1 .      Denote  Syl_p(G)  as the set of all sylow p-subgroups, and  n_p(G)  as the cardinality of  Syl_p(G) .    (1) G has subgroups of order  p^r . (How do we know this??)        A priori, it has no reason to be true but this is a theorem known as  \\textit{the first Sylow's theorem} . It states that for any finite group  G  and  p  a prime number dividing  |G| , if we write  |G|=p^rm  with  p \\nshortmid m  then  G  admits a  p -Sylow (which is defined as a subgroup of  G  whose cardinal is  p^r ).      (2) We know all sylow p-groups are conjugate and their number  n_p(G) | m , by the 2nd and 3rd Sylow Theorems.    (3) We have that  n_p(G) \\equiv 1(p).     Then  n=12=2^2*3^1  so  n_2(G)|3  gives  n_2(G) \\in \\{1,3\\}  and  n_3(G)|4  so  n_3(G) \\in \\{1,4\\}  since  2 \\not\\equiv 1(3) .    Case 1:  n_3(G) = 4.  Then the action of G by conjugation on  Syl_3(G)  gives a homomorphism  f: G \\rightarrow S_{Syl_3(G)} \\simeq S_4 .  Ker(f)  consists of  g \\in G  that normalizes all 3-Sylow subgroups. (Why?).        How is  f  defined ? Since it is given by the conjugation action  f(g):=S\\mapsto gSg^{-1}   so that if  f(g)  is trivial (the indentity function here), it follows that  f(g)  sends any  S  to  S  since  f(g)  also sends any  S  to  gSg^{-1}  this boils down to for all  S  we have  S=gSg^{-1} .       Let  P_3  be a 3-Sylow subgroup. Then the order of  P_3  is  3 . (I don't get that either)        This is the very definition of a $3$-Sylow in  G  that gives you this since  |G|=12=4\\times 3 .       , and  [G:N_G(P_3)] = 4.  Thus  P_3 \\subset N_G(P_3)  gives  P_3 = N_G(P_3) . (I'm lost here...)        Since  G  acts transitively by conjugation (this is your  p oint 2 : $p$-Sylow are all conjugate to each other) we have by the first class formula :        \\frac{|G|}{n_3(G)}=|N_G(P_3)|\\text{ whence } |N_G(P_3)|=3        By definition  H\\subseteq N_G(H)  so that  P_3\\subseteq N_G(P_3)  since both are of cardinal  3  they are equal.      So  Ker(f) = \\cap Syl_3(G) = \\{e\\}  (the intersection of the sylow 3-subgroups is trivial. (How did we arrive here...)        We already saw that  Ker(f)  is the intersection of normalizers of  3 -Sylows. Now we just saw that the normalizer of a  3 -Sylow is exactly the  3 - S ylow itself. Now I claim that if $S$ and  T  are two different  3 -Sylows they cannot but intersect trivially. Indeed by Lagrange  S\\cap T  has cardinal dividing  |S|=3 . So the cardinal is either  3  or  1 , if  |S\\cap T|=3  then  S\\cap T\\subseteq S  and  |S|=3  implies that  S\\cap T=S  and then that  S\\subseteq T  which implies (with the cardinal) that  S=T  which is impossible. It follows that  |S\\cap T|=1  i.e.  S\\cap T  is trivial.        Since  Ker(f)  is the intersection of  4  different  3 -Sylows it is necessarily trivial.      Thus we conclude that  G  is isomorphic to a subgroup of  S_4  of order 12.    To show  G  is isomorphic to  A_4 , we have that  G  has 8 elements of order 3: 4 3-sylow subgroups each has 3-1=2 elements of order 3. And  S_4  has 8 3-cycles meaning f(G) contains all 3-cycles and hence the group they generate, which is  A_4 , so  A_4 \\subset f(G) . But since  |A_4| = 12 = |f(G)  then  f(G) = A_4  and  G \\simeq A_4 . (Not understanding the first half of the proof, I do not get this part either).        Since  Ker(f)  has been proven to be trivial it follows that  G  is isomorphic to  f(G)  which is a subgroup of  S_4 . Now you would like to identify the subgroup  f(G)  you know that it contains  4   3 -Sylows. A  3 -Sylow is of order  3 , it contains two elements of order  3  and one of order  1 . Since the intersection of two different  3 -Sylows is trivial and since you have  4   3 -Sylows you finally get in  f(G)  exactly  8  elements of order  3  in  f(G) . Since they are elements of order  3  in  S_4  they cannot but be  3 -cycles and since there are  8  of them in  S_4  they are all contained in  f(G) . The fact that they generate  A_4  is classical so that  A_4\\leq f(G)  and by cardinality argument they are equal.        This part is too complicated, one way to define  A_n  is to say that this is the unique subgroup of index  2  in  S_4 . Since  S_4  is of order  24  and  f(G)  of order  12  it follows that  f(G)  is a subgroup of index  2  in  S_4  and then  A_4=f(G)  by unicity.       Case 2:  n_3(G) = 1.  The scope of the question is too large, I will need to post separately to understand the second half, unless the organizational rules of math.stackexchange would require that I post here. In that case, I'll edit the question.    I basically cannot follow the proof because it seems to skip too many steps; it would be helpful if anyone could elaborate case 1 with more reasoning so that I can follow it. Any help would be appreciated; I've spent hours trying to look up and decipher the proof but without any success.  "

Are the two point supposed to be on the ellipse? If so, then $h$ and $\\alpha$ cannot be determined, because there can multiple ellipses at the origin containing the same two points.

If any two of these are called  A  and  B , then both  E  and  E'  are possible solutions to t h e \"find $h$ and  \\alpha \" problem, but the  \\alpha  values for  E  and  E'  differ by 30 degrees.     Post-comment remarks    The squared distance from  (x(t), y(t))  to  (0,0)  is  \\begin{align} d(t)^2  &= \\left[\\cos(\\alpha) \\cos(t)  - h\\sin(\\alpha) \\sin(t)\\right]^2        +  \\left[\\sin(\\alpha) \\cos(t) + h\\cos(\\alpha) \\sin(t)\\right]^2 \\\\ &= \\cos^2(\\alpha) \\cos^2(t)  + h^2\\sin^2(\\alpha) \\sin^2(t)     - 2h\\cos(\\alpha) \\cos(t)\\sin(\\alpha) \\sin(t)         +  \\sin^2(\\alpha) \\cos^2(t) + h^2\\cos^2(\\alpha) \\sin^2(t)    + 2h\\cos(\\alpha) \\cos(t)\\sin(\\alpha) \\sin(t) \\\\ &= (\\cos^2(\\alpha) +   \\sin^2(\\alpha)) \\cos^2(t)  + h^2(\\sin^2(\\alpha) + \\sin^2(t)) \\sin^2(t) \\\\ &= \\cos^2(t)  + h^2 \\sin^2(t)  \\end{align} This varies from  1  (at  t = 0 ) to  h^2  (at  t = \\frac{\\pi}{2} ). Hence one (semi-) axis has length  1  and t h e other has length $h$. If  h < 1 , then the major (semi-)axis will have length  1 .     Note that at  t = 0 , we have  $ \\begin{align} x(0) &= \\cos(\\alpha) \\cos(0)  - h\\sin(\\alpha) \\sin(0) &= \\cos(\\alpha) \\ y(0) &= \\sin(\\alpha) \\cos(0) + h\\cos(\\alpha) \\sin(0) &= \\sin(\\alpha) \\end{align} which is an angle  \\alpha  from the positive  x$-axis, as required.     It's possible that you still don't believe me, so here's some Matlab code:    function y = ellipseTest() hList = [0.1, 0.3, 0.7];            % three different eccentricities alphaList = [20, 50, 130] * pi/180; % three different major-axis angles t = linspace(0, 2*pi, 100);         % sample values from 0 to 2pi colorList = ['r', 'g', 'b']; figure(gcf);  clf; hold on  for i = 1:3    h = hList(i); alpha = alphaList(i); color = colorList(i);      x = cos(alpha) * cos(t)  - h * sin(alpha) * sin(t);     y = sin(alpha) * cos(t)  + h * cos(alpha) * sin(t);      plot(x, y, color) end hold off; set(gca, 'DataAspectRatio', [1 1 1]); figure(gcf);     and the resulting figure:     I find these pretty compelling.     Note that each pair of ellipses intersects in two points in the first quadrant, so if you picked one of these sets-of-two-points for your part 2 question, you'd find two different ellipses that fit them.

        "body": "I couldn't find that book in our library so I need to guess the meaning of the divisor of a form on a curve. I assume that it means that each point in the intersection of the projective curves   X^3Y+Y^3Z+Z^3X=0\\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad Z=0   is multiplied by some kind of intersection multiplicity. I further guess that this multiplicity is defined by calculating the (exponential) valuation of the defining function of the latter curve at a point of intersection (or, more precisely, in the local ring).    So here we can see  Q_1=(1:0:0)  as the origin  u=v=0 , where  u=Y/X  and  v=Z/X  are the affine coordinates on this piece. This affine piece of the Klein quartic is defined by the equation  P(u,v)=u+u^3v+v^3=0 . Also, in this piece  X=1 , so  Z=v  (this is admittedly shady - hopefully an algebraic geometer can comment eventually). The partial derivative  \\partial P/\\partial u=1+3u^2v+3v^2  does not vanish at  Q_1 , so we can use  v-v(Q_1)=v-0=v  as a local parameter. So if we denote by  \\nu_1  the discrete valuation at  Q_1 , we have  \\nu_1(v)=1 . Therefore the point  Q_1  appears with multiplicity 1.    With  Q_2  we need to go to the affine piece  Y=1 , and use affine coordinates  r=X/Y  and  s=Z/Y . The equation of the quartic then becomes  R(r,s)=r^3+s+s^3r=0 . As above we see that  r  is a local variable at  Q_2 . If  \\nu_2  is the corresponding valuation, we thus have  \\nu_2(r)=1 . The form  Z  agree s  with the function $s$ on this affine plane, so we need to compute  \\nu_2(s) . Becau s e $s$ vanishes at  Q_2 , we know that  \\nu_2(s)\\ge 1 . The equation of the curve gives us the relation   3=\\nu_2(r^3)=\\nu_2(s+s^3r).   Here  \\nu_2(s^3r)=3\\cdot\\nu_2(s)+\\nu_2(r)\\ge 4 , so by the non-archimedean triangle inequality we must have  \\nu_2(s)=3 .    All this suggests that the divisor you are looking for really is, indeed,  1\\cdot Q_1+3\\cdot Q_2 . Unfortunately it is impossible for me to check that this calculation is a valid answer in view of what has been covered in your book up to this point.  "

Proof  for  theorem  : First, let us prove $a_{4m+1}\\gt b_{4m+1}$ for $m\\in\\mathbb N  by induction. In order to prove the  m=1$ case, it is sufficient to prove   \\begin{align}{\\pi}^{{\\pi}^e}\\gt e^{e^{\\pi}}(\\log\\pi)+\\log(\\log\\pi)\\qquad(2)\\end{align}  Now let us consider the following equation :   \\begin{align}\\log\\left(\\frac{{\\pi}^{{\\pi}^{e}}}{e^{e^{\\pi}}(\\log\\pi)}\\right)={\\pi}^e(\\log\\pi)-e^{\\pi}-\\log(\\log\\pi)\\qquad(3)\\end{align}  Now let us define a function $f(x)$ as the following :   f(x):=x^ee^{-x}(\\log x)\\ \\ (x\\in [e,\\pi])  Hence we get  f^{\\prime}(x)=x^{e-1}e^{-x}\\{1-(x-e)\\log x\\}.  By mean value theorem, there exists $\\xi\\in(e,\\pi)$ such that  \\begin{align}f(x)-f(e)=(\\pi-e)f^{\\prime}(\\xi)\\qquad(4)\\end{align}  Here, noting that $f(\\pi)={\\pi}^ee^{-\\pi}(\\log\\pi)  and that  f(e)=1 ,  (4)$ tells us that   {\\pi}^e\\log\\pi-e^{\\pi}=e^{\\pi}(\\pi-e)e^{-\\xi}{\\xi}^{e-1}\\{1-(\\xi-e)\\log\\xi\\}\\gt(\\pi-e)\\cdot 1\\cdot e^{e-1}\\{1-(\\pi-e)\\log\\pi\\}.  Here, since $0\\lt \\pi-e\\lt 3.2-2.7=\\frac 12$, lemma 1 tells us that   {\\pi}^e\\log\\pi-e^{\\pi}\\gt e\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{e}-1\\right)\\cdot 2\\left(1-\\frac 12\\cdot\\frac{\\pi}{e}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{e}-1\\right)(2e-\\pi)\\gt (\\log\\pi-1)(2e-\\pi).  Then, noting that $\\log\\pi-1=e^{\\log(\\log\\pi)}-1\\gt (1+\\log(\\log\\pi))-1=\\log(\\log\\pi)  and that  2e-\\pi\\gt 2\\times 2.7-3.2=2.2\\gt 2$, we get  \\begin{align}{\\pi}^e\\log\\pi-e^{\\pi}\\gt 2\\log(\\log\\pi)\\qquad(5)\\end{align}  Hence, $(3)(5)$ tells us that  \\log\\left(\\frac{{\\pi}^{{\\pi}^e}}{e^{e^{\\pi}}(\\log\\pi)}\\right)\\gt 2\\log(\\log\\pi)-\\log(\\log\\pi)=\\log(\\log\\pi).  Hence, since   {\\pi}^{{\\pi}^{e}}\\gt e^{e^{\\pi}}(\\log\\pi)e^{\\log(\\log\\pi)}\\gt e^{e^{\\pi}}(\\log\\pi)(1+\\log(\\log\\pi))\\gt e^{e^{\\pi}}\\log\\pi+\\log(\\log\\pi),  we know that the $m=1  case is proven.    Now suppose that a_{4m+1}\\gt b_{4m+1}  for some  m\\ge 1$. Then, lemma 3 tells us that   {\\pi}^{{\\pi}^{e^{e^{b_{4m+1}}}}}\\lt e^{e^{{\\pi}^{{\\pi}^{a_{4m+1}}}}}.  Hence, since   b_{4m+5}={\\pi}^{b_{4m+4}}={\\pi}^{{\\pi}^{a_{4m+3}}}={\\pi}^{{\\pi}^{e^{a_{4m+2}}}}={\\pi}^{{\\pi}^{e^{e^{b_{4m+1}}}}},  we get $b_{4m+5}\\lt a_{4m+5} .     Now we can prove that a_{4m+1}\\gt b_{4m+1}  for any  m\\in\\mathbb N .    Noting that \\log\\pi\\gt 1$, we get  a_{4m}=\\log e^{a_{4m}}=\\log a_{4m+1}\\gt \\log b_{4m+1}=\\log {\\pi}^{b_{4m}}=b_{4m}\\log\\pi\\gt b_{4m}.

Since  [\\Bbb{Q}(\\alpha):\\Bbb{Q}]  is the dimension of  \\Bbb{Q}(\\alpha)  over  \\Bbb{Q}  as a  vector space , this means that there are  q_0,\\dotsc,q_{m-1} \\in \\Bbb{Q}  such that   \\alpha^m = q_0 + q_1 \\alpha + \\dotsb + q_{m-1} \\alpha^{m-1}   hence  \\alpha  is a root of  g(X) = X^m - q_{m-1} X^{m-1} - \\dotsb - q_0 . By the aforementioned fact it follows that  g  divides  f  in  \\Bbb{Q}(X) , but this is absurd because  f  is irreducible.       As for what happens when adjoining other roots, that depends on how much your field differs from being Galois.    For example, consider  f(X) = X^3 - d , with  d  a cube-free integer. Then its roots are  \\sqrt[3]{d},\\zeta_3\\sqrt[3]{d},\\zeta_3\\sqrt[3]{d} , where  \\zeta_3  is a primitive root of unity, i.e. a root of  X^2 + X + 1 . Then  \\Bbb{Q}(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2) = \\Bbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{d},\\zeta_3)  has degree  6  for any two distinct roots  \\alpha_1,\\alpha_2  o f  $f$.    On the other hand, say, adding any root of  X^4 + X^3 + X^2 + X + 1  to  \\Bbb{Q}(\\zeta_5)  won't change the degree of the extension (which is  5 ).       Regarding your speci f ic problem : The splitting field of an irreducible cubic polynomial $f$ with rational coefficients can have either degree  3  or degree  6 . In particular i f , like in your case, $f$ has only one real root, then its splitting field has degree  6 . For example, you can  f ind the full treatment of this at  PlanetMath , where there is a proof that the splitting field of $f$ is   \\Bbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\sqrt{D})   where  \\alpha  and  D  are, respectively, a root and the discriminant o f   f .    Note : $f$ has one real and two complex roots  iff  its discriminant is negative, thus in this case it is always true that  \\sqrt{D} \\notin \\Bbb{Q} .  "

Edit : I add a proof of the above claim here. You can skip this if you know the proof.        To prove the equivalence, we consider the general case  a\\equiv b\\pmod n  and let  n=\\prod_{i=1}^{m}{p_i}^{k_i}  be the prime decompositio n  of $n$. Since  n\\mid a-b  and  {p_i}^{k_i}\\mid n  for each of  i=1,2,...,m , we immediately have  {p_i}^{k_i}\\mid a-b . This proves that the original congruence implies the system of congruences.        For the converse, suppose  {p_i}^{k_i}\\mid a-b  for each of  i=1,2,...,m . That is, we assume the system of congruences holds. Using  this theorem , since the prime powers are coprime, you can show inductively that the whole product divides  a-b . That is,  \\prod_{i=1}^{m}{p_i}^{k_i}\\mid a-b.  But the product is just equal to  n . So  n\\mid a-b . This proves that the system of congruences implies the original congruence.      We now simplify each of the congruences. It is easy to see that  3^{999^{100}}  is a multiple of  9 . Since  \\phi(9)=6 , and that  960  is a multiple of  6 , we have  7^{960^{961}}\\equiv 7^{6n}\\equiv 1\\pmod {9} , where  n=\\frac{960^{961}}{6}  is a positive integer.    For the second congruence, observe that  \\phi(25)=20 , and  999^{100}\\equiv (-1)^{100}\\equiv 1\\pmod{20} , so  999^{100}-1=20m , where  m=\\frac{999^{100}-1}{20}  is a positive integer. Then  3^{999^{100}}\\equiv 3^{20m+1}\\equiv 3\\pmod{25} .  960  is a multiple of  20 . So  7^{960^{961}}\\equiv 7^{20k}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{25} , where  k=\\frac{960^{961}}{20} . We have arrived at the system  \\begin{cases}a\\equiv 1\\pmod {9}\\\\\\\\a\\equiv 4\\pmod {25}\\end{cases}.  You can solve this by Chinese Remainder Theorem.  "

If the domain is  simply-connected  (for example, a sphere, a box, but not cup with a handle), then this field must be a conservative field, i.e.,  \\mathbf{v} = \\nabla \\phi .   In general, we can have non-conservative field having zero curl. Let   Z = \\mathrm{ker}(\\nabla\\times) := \\{\\mathbf{w} \\text{ is smooth}: \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{w} = 0\\},   which is the space of the fields having zero curl and   B = \\mathrm{im}(\\nabla) = \\{\\nabla \\psi: \\psi \\text{ is smooth}\\},  which is the range of the gradient operator (i.e., all gradient fields). Then    \\mathrm{dim}\\big(Z/B\\big) = \\beta_1\\tag{1}   where  \\beta_1  is the  first Betti number  of the domain of interest  \\Omega , and   \\beta_1 = (\\# \\text{ of holes in the domain})  roughly speaking. (1) essentially means:   \\text{Field whose curl is zero} = \\text{Conservative vector field } + \\text{\"Something\"}. \\tag{2}   This \"something\" here is a  \\beta_1 -dimensional space.    (1) is the by the coincidence of the dimension of the de Rham cohomology group and homology group. For simply connected domain  \\beta_1 =0 . If the domain has  k  holes, the difference is a  k -dimensional space.    Intuition: To be honest I don't know the intuition here either, if someone knows please enlighten me as well.    How to find this \"something\": Let's use that example in the  wiki's entry of conservative fields  AWertheim mentioned in the first comment, but modify it a little bit. For an infinite cylinder  C_{x=y=0,z\\in (-\\infty,\\infty)}(1)  with radius 1 in  \\mathbb{R}^3  that contains the origin, we dig a hole of radius  \\epsilon  along  z -axis:   \\Omega = C_{x=y=0,z\\in (-\\infty,\\infty)}(1)\\backslash  C_{x=y=0,z\\in (-\\infty,\\infty)}(\\epsilon)  Then by above, that \"something\" is a dimension 1 space. Let  \\mathbf{A}  be a member of this something, we can pose a boundary value problem which is the technique used in Helmholtz decomposition of vector fields:  \\left\\{ \\begin{aligned} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A} &= 0\\quad \\text{ in }\\Omega \\\\ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A} &= 0 \\quad \\text{ in }\\Omega \\\\ \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\oint_{\\gamma_C} \\mathbf{A} \\cdot d\\mathbf{s} &= 1  \\\\ \\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} &= 0 \\quad \\text{ on }\\Gamma, \\end{aligned} \\right.  where  \\gamma_C   is a counterclockwise closed curve lived on that interior cylinder surface with winding number 1, and  \\Gamma  is the boundary of the exterior cylinder. We can find that this  \\mathbf{A}  is what wikipedia's entry has:   \\mathbf{A} = \\left( \\frac{-y}{x^2+y^2}, \\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}, 0 \\right).   That \"something\" in (2) is just a multiple of  \\mathbf{A} . And now we can say that if  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{v} = 0  in  \\Omega  above, then    \\mathbf{v} = \\nabla \\phi + c\\mathbf{A},   where  c  is a constant.   Relevant question:  What is the solution to Nash's problem presented in \"A Beautiful Mind\"?   Your last question: You can learn div, curl, and grad in Calculus III I believe. Like Green theorem, Divergence theorem, and Stokes theorem.    "

The idea is that whenever we find a prime $p$ such that  p\\mid 4^m+2^m+1  but  p\\nmid 100^m+10^m+1  we have shown that  4^m+2^m+1\\nmid 100^m+10^m+1 . When hunting for suitable  p rimes $p$ we can simply look at the factorizations of these numbers. For  p>3  to be a factor of  k^{2m}+k^m+1=(k^{3m}-1)/(k^m-1)  we see that  k^m  has to be a  p rimitive third root of unity modulo $p$. We obviously apply this to both  k=2  and  k=10 .     To get those primitive third roots of unity we need  \\ell=\\operatorname{ord}_p(2)  to be divisible by three. If  \\ell=3u  we then see that  p\\mid 4^m+2^m+1  if and only if  m\\equiv u,2u\\pmod{3u} .  But, if  t=\\operatorname{ord}_p(10)  is also divisible by three, say  t=3v , we also have that  p\\mid 100^m+10^m+1  whenever  m\\equiv v,2v\\pmod{3v} . Anyway, this allows to conclude that  m  cannot be in certain residue classes modulo  3w  where  w=\\operatorname{lcm}(u,v) . Observe  t hat if $t$ is not a multiple of three, then  100^m+10^m+1  is never divisible by  p , because  10^m  is then never a primitive third root of unity.    Getting our hands dirty we see that:      With  p=7  we have  \\ell=3  and  t=6 , both divisible by three. This means that when  m\\equiv1,5\\pmod6  we have  7\\mid 4^m+2^m+1  and  7\\nmid 100^m+10^m+1 .   With  p=73\\mid 2^9-1  we have  \\ell=9=3\\cdot3  and  t=8 . This means that  73\\mid 4^m+2^m+1  iff  m\\equiv3,6\\pmod9 . But  100^m+10^m+1  is never divisible by  73  so we have covered these values of  m . At this point we have excluded  10  out of  18  residue classes modulo  18 , so we have covered more than half the integers.   The prime  p=13  is a factor of  2^{12}-1  and  \\ell=12 . But here  t=6  is a factor of  \\ell . This is bad news for us. No values of  m  can be excluded. For if  m\\equiv4,8\\pmod{12}  then automatically  m\\equiv2,4\\pmod{6} . In these cases  13  is a common factor of both  4^m+2^m+1  and  100^m+10^m+1 . The same thing happens whenever  2  is a  p rimitive root modulo $p$. We really need to look for non-primitive cases.   With  p=151\\mid 2^{15}-1  we have  \\ell=15=3\\cdot5 . Here  t=75=3\\cdot25 . This  m eans that we can rule out $m$, if  m\\equiv5,10\\pmod{15}  and  m\\not\\equiv25,50\\pmod{75} .    With  p=241\\mid 2^{24}-1  we have  \\ell=24=3\\cdot8 . Here  t=30=3\\cdot10 . We can rule ouf  m , if  m\\equiv8,16\\pmod{24}  and  m\\not\\equiv10,20\\pmod{30} .      At this point we have ruled out  1216  residue classes modulo  1800 , so we reached the two thirds point. That modulus  1800  is the least common multiple of  6,9,75,24  and  30  that all appeared above. Recalling that  m=0,2,4  are solutions the s m allest values of $m$ that we have not yet covered are  m=9,14,18,22 . Stopping here for now.  "

The nested interval theorem made me feel the length of a point should be  0 ...      I  don't think that the nested interval theorem comes into play here, because it does not require length to be defined. Let's define a set $I$ as a set of all  intervals  in  \\Bbb{R} , length of an interval is a function  L: I \\rightarrow \\Bbb{R} , naturally we can say that  i f $i$ \u2013 an interval with endpoints  a, b  then  L(i) = d(a, b) , where function  d: \\Bbb{R}x\\Bbb{R} \\rightarrow \\Bbb{R}  is a  distance  (not necessarily Euclidean). Now we need to extend the definition of length to a point, because so far L defined on the set of subsets of  \\Bbb{R}  we called  I . Value  L(x), where \\space x \\in \\Bbb{R}  is undefined. A natural way to e x tend the definition of length is to view an element $x$ as a single element set  \\{x\\} , which in turn can be expressed as an interval  [x, x] , then  L([x, x]) = d(x, x)  which is  0  according to the  definition of distance .  Not to confuse with Cardinality of a single element set:  |\\{x\\}| = 1 .         ...however I think the width of the gap being  0  is equivalent to there being no such gap on the real number line...      I think the closest thing to having no gaps in a metric space is  Cauchy Completness . If  \\Bbb{R}^x = \\Bbb{R} \\setminus \\{x\\},  then  \\Bbb{R}^x  is not complete, because there is a  Cauchy sequence  of numbers  {x_n}  with the following properties:  x_n \\in \\Bbb{R^x}  and  \\lim_{{n\\to\\infty}}x_n=x , but  x \\notin \\Bbb{R}^x .

It's sets of real number that are measurable or not. So the correct statement would be: the set of all real numbers that include the number $2$ in their decimal notation (let's name it  A ) is Borel measurable.        A  set $A$ is borel measurable if  A \\in \\mathcal{A}  the Borel  \\sigma  algebra. Is it possible to proof the definition of a  \\sigma  algebra that  A  is closed under complementation and closed under countable unions?      Absolutely not. Being closed under complementation and countable unions is a property a family of sets  \\mathcal{S}  can have; then we call that family a  \\sigma -algebra. But  A  is a set of real numbers, so it doesn't make sense to ask whether it is closed under complementation or countable unions.    The family  \\mathcal{A}  of Borel sets is a  \\sigma -algebra and a set  S  is Borel if  S \\in \\mathcal{A} . So our goal is not to show that  A  is a  \\sigma -algebra (which doesn't make sense), but that  A \\in \\mathcal{A} .

Now to the question: note that  A  can be written as     A = \\bigcup_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} A_k    where  A_k  is the set of all real numbers that have a  2  in their decimal notation exactly on the place  k , i.e.     A_k = \\left\\{ \\pm \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{m} a_n \\cdot 10^n : k \\leqslant m \\ \\& \\ a_k = 2 \\right\\}    where  a_n 's are the digits of the expansion, so  a_n \\in \\{ 0, 1, \\ldots, 9 \\} . Try proving that each  A_k  is Borel, which will conclude the proof, since a countable union of Borel sets is Borel.  "

For  rational  exponents,  \\alpha = \\frac{p}{q}  with  p  and  q  integers,  q\\gt 0 ,  \\gcd(p,q)=1 , let's define  a^{\\alpha}=a^{p/q}  as (i) the unique real num b ers $b$ such that  b^{q} = a^p  if  q  is odd; and (ii) the unique nonnegative real  b  such that  b^q=a^p  if  q  is even and  a\\geq 0 . (The expression is not defined for  q  even and  a\\lt 0 ).    For  rational  exponents the limit rule can be deduced from the integer case. Write  \\alpha=\\frac{p}{q}  with  p  and  q  integers,  \\gcd(p,q)=1 . Assuming  f(x)  is positive in  a  neighborhood of $a$ when  q  is even, and that the limit  \\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)  exists, consider  g(x) = (f(x)^{\\alpha})^q = f(x)^p . Then we have (by the integer case),  \\lim_{x\\to a}g(x) = \\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)^p = \\left(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)\\right)^p.  On the other hand,  \\lim_{x\\to a}g(x) = \\lim_{x\\to a}\\left(f(x)^{\\alpha}\\right)^q = \\left(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)^{\\alpha}\\right)^q   provided that  \\lim\\limits_{x\\to a}(f(x)^{\\alpha})  exists .  Therefore, if that limit exists, we have:  \\left(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)\\right)^p = \\left(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)^{\\alpha}\\right)^q.  Taking  q th roots on both sides, we get  \\left(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)\\right)^{\\alpha} = \\lim_{x\\to a}\\left(f(x)^{\\alpha}\\right).    Added.  To establish the existence of  \\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)^{\\alpha} , however, you would need to do some work with continuous functions. Spivak postpones it until Theorem 3 of Chapter 12, from which you can deduce that  y\\mapsto y^{1/q}  for integer  q  is continuous where defined (because  x\\mapsto x^q  is continuous); the fact that the limit of  g  exists then guarantees the limit of  g^{1/q} = f^{\\alpha}  also exists. So the above argument is somewhat \"holey\".    For irrational exponents, one definition is as a limit of  rational  exponents. That is, pick a sequence  q_n\\to\\alpha  with  q_n  rationals; then we define  f(x)^{\\alpha} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}f(x)^{q_n}.  This leads to double limits, which are complicated. (We can only do this for positive bases).    Another definition is via the exponential and logarithm functions. We define  a^b = \\exp(b\\ln(a))  (so only for positive bases again), and then use the fact that the exponential and logarithm functions are continuous, so   \\begin{align*}  \\lim_{x\\to a}\\left(f(x)^{\\alpha}\\right) &= \\lim_{x\\to a}\\exp\\left(\\alpha\\ln(f(x))\\right)\\\\   &= \\exp\\left(\\lim_{x\\to a}\\alpha\\ln(f(x))\\right)\\\\  &= \\exp\\left(\\alpha\\ln\\left(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)\\right)\\right) \\\\  &= \\left(\\lim_{x\\to a}f(x)\\right)^{\\alpha}\\end{align*}  which gives the desired result.

The dividing both sides by  p^k , we find that we want   2ct\\equiv d\\pmod{p}.\\tag{1}  Since  p  is odd, we have  2c\\not\\equiv 0\\pmod{p} . I t  follows that the congruence (1) has a solution $t$. Thus from a solution mod  p^k  we have produced a solution mod  p^{k+1} . Finally, we work our way from  k=1  all the way to  n .

Edit : I add a proof of the above claim here. You can skip this if you know the proof.        To prove the equivalence, we consider the general case  a\\equiv b\\pmod n  and let  n=\\prod_{i=1}^{m}{p_i}^{k_i}  be the prime decompositio n  of $n$. Since  n\\mid a-b  and  {p_i}^{k_i}\\mid n  for each of  i=1,2,...,m , we immediately have  {p_i}^{k_i}\\mid a-b . This proves that the original congruence implies the system of congruences.        For the converse, suppose  {p_i}^{k_i}\\mid a-b  for each of  i=1,2,...,m . That is, we assume the system of congruences holds. Using  this theorem , since the prime powers are coprime, you can show inductively that the whole product divides  a-b . That is,  \\prod_{i=1}^{m}{p_i}^{k_i}\\mid a-b.  But the product is just equal to  n . So  n\\mid a-b . This proves that the system of congruences implies the original congruence.      We now simplify each of the congruences. It is easy to see that  3^{999^{100}}  is a multiple of  9 . Since  \\phi(9)=6 , and that  960  is a multiple of  6 , we have  7^{960^{961}}\\equiv 7^{6n}\\equiv 1\\pmod {9} , where  n=\\frac{960^{961}}{6}  is a positive integer.    For the second congruence, observe that  \\phi(25)=20 , and  999^{100}\\equiv (-1)^{100}\\equiv 1\\pmod{20} , so  999^{100}-1=20m , where  m=\\frac{999^{100}-1}{20}  is a positive integer. Then  3^{999^{100}}\\equiv 3^{20m+1}\\equiv 3\\pmod{25} .  960  is a multiple of  20 . So  7^{960^{961}}\\equiv 7^{20k}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{25} , where  k=\\frac{960^{961}}{20} . We have arrived at the system  \\begin{cases}a\\equiv 1\\pmod {9}\\\\\\\\a\\equiv 4\\pmod {25}\\end{cases}.  You can solve this by Chinese Remainder Theorem.  "

Suppose  M  is the unique maximal ideal of a commutative  A rtini a n ring $A$. Suppose $a$ is a nonzero element.

Added:  Having given the matter a bit more thought, I can prove the following theorem.

Edit : I add a proof of the above claim here. You can skip this if you know the proof.        To prove the equivalence, we consider the general case  a\\equiv b\\pmod n  and let  n=\\prod_{i=1}^{m}{p_i}^{k_i}  be the prime decompositio n  of $n$. Since  n\\mid a-b  and  {p_i}^{k_i}\\mid n  for each of  i=1,2,...,m , we immediately have  {p_i}^{k_i}\\mid a-b . This proves that the original congruence implies the system of congruences.        For the converse, suppose  {p_i}^{k_i}\\mid a-b  for each of  i=1,2,...,m . That is, we assume the system of congruences holds. Using  this theorem , since the prime powers are coprime, you can show inductively that the whole product divides  a-b . That is,  \\prod_{i=1}^{m}{p_i}^{k_i}\\mid a-b.  But the product is just equal to  n . So  n\\mid a-b . This proves that the system of congruences implies the original congruence.      We now simplify each of the congruences. It is easy to see that  3^{999^{100}}  is a multiple of  9 . Since  \\phi(9)=6 , and that  960  is a multiple of  6 , we have  7^{960^{961}}\\equiv 7^{6n}\\equiv 1\\pmod {9} , where  n=\\frac{960^{961}}{6}  is a positive integer.    For the second congruence, observe that  \\phi(25)=20 , and  999^{100}\\equiv (-1)^{100}\\equiv 1\\pmod{20} , so  999^{100}-1=20m , where  m=\\frac{999^{100}-1}{20}  is a positive integer. Then  3^{999^{100}}\\equiv 3^{20m+1}\\equiv 3\\pmod{25} .  960  is a multiple of  20 . So  7^{960^{961}}\\equiv 7^{20k}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{25} , where  k=\\frac{960^{961}}{20} . We have arrived at the system  \\begin{cases}a\\equiv 1\\pmod {9}\\\\\\\\a\\equiv 4\\pmod {25}\\end{cases}.  You can solve this by Chinese Remainder Theorem.  "

In fact, because this special case implies the general case it is pretty inconceivable to me how this could be proved by induction. The special case  a = 1  can be proved in a si m pler way, using the $m$-th cyclotomic polynomial, so you have a theorem with a single parameter in it, and I've never seen a proof of that version by induction either.    2) For  n \\geq 2 , the partial sums  H_n = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + \\cdots + 1/n  are not integers.     The proofs I know are based on studying the highest power of  2  less tha n  or equal to  n  rather than any kind of direct induction on $n$. If  H_n  is not an integer how can that raw fact help you show  H_{n+1}  is  n ot an integer? To use induction you'd be trying to show a \"non-property\" persists from $n$ to  n+1  (or from all integers from  2  to  n  on to  n+1 ). If someone says that the proof is by induction on the highest power of  2  less tha n  or equal to   n  then I'd point out that the proof does not  use  anything about $n$ to get the result for  n+1 .    3) A partial example: for  n \\geq 2 , the number  \\sqrt[n]{2}  is irrational.      I consider this partial because, while the direct statement is not easily accessible to induction (the numbers  \\sqrt[n]{2}  and  \\sqrt[n+1]{2}  are linearly disjoint over  \\mathbf Q , so it's hard to imagine how, to a beginner, the irrationality of  \\sqrt[n]{2}  could help you prove irrationality of  \\sqrt[n+1]{2} ), it could be seen as a consequence of the more general result that if a prime -- or just the specific prime  2  -- divides a product of  n  integers then it must divide one of them, and  that  is provable by induction.    4) Consider giving the class some unsolved problems about integers, e.g., for every  n \\geq 2  the infinite series  1 + 1/2^n + 1/3^n + 1/4^n + \\dots  is irratio n al. It's proved for even $n$ and for  n = 3 , but unproved for  n = 5 .     5) Bertrand's postulate: for every integer  n \\geq 1  there is a  p rime number $p$ with  n \\leq p \\leq 2n . (I use  \\leq  instead of  <  so the result is true all the way down to  n = 1 .)     More ge n erally, lots of theorems about the location of prime numbers are not accessible to proofs by induction (so far) since primality is not really a condition that respects the passage from $n$ to  n+1 .    6) Lagrange's four-square theorem: every integer  n \\geq 1  is a sum of four perfect squares.      That is proved by doi n g it first for primes (usi n g special methods exploiti n g primality of $n$) and then concluding it in general by prime factorization and Euler's four-square identity. You could say this is proved by induction on the number of prime factors of $n$, but to a beginner it's definitely defensible to say this can't be proved as far as we can tell by reasoning from $n$ to  n+1 . Nobody k n ows how to turn a representation of $n$ as a sum of four squares into a representation of  n+1  as a sum of four squares.  "

It's sets of real number that are measurable or not.

A  set $A$ is borel measurable if  A \\in \\mathcal{A}  the Borel  \\sigma  algebra.

Being closed under complementation and countable unions is a property a family of sets  \\mathcal{S}  can have; then we call that family a  \\sigma -algebra. But  A  is a set of real numbers, so it doesn't make sense to ask whether it is closed under complementation or countable unions.

The nested interval theorem made me feel the length of a point should be  0 ...      I  don't think that the nested interval theorem comes into play here, because it does not require length to be defined. Let's define a set $I$ as a set of all  intervals  in  \\Bbb{R} , length of an interval is a function  L: I \\rightarrow \\Bbb{R} , naturally we can say that  i f $i$ \u2013 an interval with endpoints  a, b  then  L(i) = d(a, b) , where function  d: \\Bbb{R}x\\Bbb{R} \\rightarrow \\Bbb{R}  is a  distance  (not necessarily Euclidean).

A natural way to e x tend the definition of length is to view an element $x$ as a single element set  \\{x\\} , which in turn can be expressed as an interval  [x, x] , then  L([x, x]) = d(x, x)  which is  0  according to the  definition of distance .

I think the closest thing to having no gaps in a metric space is  Cauchy Completness . If  \\Bbb{R}^x = \\Bbb{R} \\setminus \\{x\\},  then  \\Bbb{R}^x  is not complete, because there is a  Cauchy sequence  of numbers  {x_n}  with the following properties:  x_n \\in \\Bbb{R^x}  and  \\lim_{{n\\to\\infty}}x_n=x , but  x \\notin \\Bbb{R}^x .

Thus, it's enough to prove that  \\sum_{cyc}x\\left(-\\frac{20}{1521}y^2-\\frac{32}{1521}y+\\frac{1}{9}\\right)\\geq\\frac{3}{13}  or  \\sum_{cyc}(8xy+5x^2z)\\leq39.  Now, let  \\{x,y,z\\}=\\{a,b,c\\} , where  a\\geq b\\geq c .    Thus, by Rearrangement and AM-GM we obtain:  x^2z+y^2x+z^2y=x\\cdot xz+y\\cdot yx+z\\cdot zy\\leq a\\cdot ab+b\\cdot ac+c\\cdot bc=   =b(a^2+ac+c^2)=b(a+c)^2-abc=   =4b\\left(\\frac{a+c}{2}\\right)^2-xyz\\leq4\\left(\\frac{b+\\frac{a+c}{2}+\\frac{a+c}{2}}{3}\\right)^3-xyz=4-xyz.  Thus, it remains to prove that  8(xy+xz+yz)-5xyz\\leq19.  Now, let  x+y+z=3u ,  xy+xz+yz=3v^2  and  xyz=w^3 .    Hence, we need to prove that  24uv^2-5w^3\\leq19u^3.  But by Schur  w^3\\geq4uv^2-3u^3.    Thus, it's enough to prove that  19u^3+5(4uv^2-3u^3)-24uv^2\\geq0  or  u(u^2-v^2)\\geq0,  which is obvious.    Done!  "

The second question is an annoyingly delicate arithmetic question (e.g. the lcm depends delicately on whether a large cycle happens to have prime length) so I am tempted to ignore it to concentrate on the first question.    Here is what I know about cycle lengths of random permutations. First, it's a nice exercise to show that the expected number of cycles of length  k \\le n  i n  a permutation of $n$ elements is  \\frac{1}{k} , and hence the total expected number of cycles is    H_n = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{1}{k} \\approx \\log n.    When  k \\ll n  one can make much stronger statements: as  n \\to \\infty , the number of cycles of length  k \\ll n  is asymptotically Poisson with parameter  \\frac{1}{k} . Moreover, for various  k \\ll n  these Poisson random variables are asymptotically jointly independent. See  this blog post  for some details.    Unfortunately, I don't  k now much about large $k$.     Edit:  An upper bound for the lcm of the cycle lengths is their product, and we can say something about that. The product is just  \\prod k^{c_k}  where  c_k  is the number of cycles of length  k , so the logarithm of the product is    \\sum_{k=1}^n c_k \\log k.    If we assume that the  c_k  are, for all  k , jointly Poisson with parameter  \\frac{1}{k} , then we can compute the moments of this logarithm. For example, its expected value is    \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\log k}{k} \\approx \\frac{(\\log n)^2}{2}.    Plugging in  n = 52  gives that the exponential of the expected value of the logarithm of the product is about  2400 , which is at least within an order of magnitude of what you got.   "

If the domain is  simply-connected  (for example, a sphere, a box, but not cup with a handle), then this field must be a conservative field, i.e.,  \\mathbf{v} = \\nabla \\phi .   In general, we can have non-conservative field having zero curl. Let   Z = \\mathrm{ker}(\\nabla\\times) := \\{\\mathbf{w} \\text{ is smooth}: \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{w} = 0\\},   which is the space of the fields having zero curl and   B = \\mathrm{im}(\\nabla) = \\{\\nabla \\psi: \\psi \\text{ is smooth}\\},  which is the range of the gradient operator (i.e., all gradient fields). Then    \\mathrm{dim}\\big(Z/B\\big) = \\beta_1\\tag{1}   where  \\beta_1  is the  first Betti number  of the domain of interest  \\Omega , and   \\beta_1 = (\\# \\text{ of holes in the domain})  roughly speaking. (1) essentially means:   \\text{Field whose curl is zero} = \\text{Conservative vector field } + \\text{\"Something\"}. \\tag{2}   This \"something\" here is a  \\beta_1 -dimensional space.    (1) is the by the coincidence of the dimension of the de Rham cohomology group and homology group. For simply connected domain  \\beta_1 =0 . If the domain has  k  holes, the difference is a  k -dimensional space.    Intuition: To be honest I don't know the intuition here either, if someone knows please enlighten me as well.    How to find this \"something\": Let's use that example in the  wiki's entry of conservative fields  AWertheim mentioned in the first comment, but modify it a little bit. For an infinite cylinder  C_{x=y=0,z\\in (-\\infty,\\infty)}(1)  with radius 1 in  \\mathbb{R}^3  that contains the origin, we dig a hole of radius  \\epsilon  along  z -axis:   \\Omega = C_{x=y=0,z\\in (-\\infty,\\infty)}(1)\\backslash  C_{x=y=0,z\\in (-\\infty,\\infty)}(\\epsilon)  Then by above, that \"something\" is a dimension 1 space. Let  \\mathbf{A}  be a member of this something, we can pose a boundary value problem which is the technique used in Helmholtz decomposition of vector fields:  \\left\\{ \\begin{aligned} \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A} &= 0\\quad \\text{ in }\\Omega \\\\ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A} &= 0 \\quad \\text{ in }\\Omega \\\\ \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\oint_{\\gamma_C} \\mathbf{A} \\cdot d\\mathbf{s} &= 1  \\\\ \\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} &= 0 \\quad \\text{ on }\\Gamma, \\end{aligned} \\right.  where  \\gamma_C   is a counterclockwise closed curve lived on that interior cylinder surface with winding number 1, and  \\Gamma  is the boundary of the exterior cylinder. We can find that this  \\mathbf{A}  is what wikipedia's entry has:   \\mathbf{A} = \\left( \\frac{-y}{x^2+y^2}, \\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}, 0 \\right).   That \"something\" in (2) is just a multiple of  \\mathbf{A} . And now we can say that if  \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{v} = 0  in  \\Omega  above, then    \\mathbf{v} = \\nabla \\phi + c\\mathbf{A},   where  c  is a constant.   Relevant question:  What is the solution to Nash's problem presented in \"A Beautiful Mind\"?   Your last question: You can learn div, curl, and grad in Calculus III I believe.

I start by defining  f \\colon Z_2 \\times Z_2 \\times Z_2 \\to U(24)   by  f((a,b,c)) = 12a + 6b + 4c + 1 \\pmod{24} .      The OP is trying to show that two groups are isomorphic, and uses a formula to propose what they hope is an isomorphism; a function taking elements of one group to another (with other properties).    The comment  in question:        [M]aybe write out the group tables for each group and see if you can \"see\" an isomorphism. I wouldn't recommend going the formula route. Any chance you know anything about the classification of finite Abelian groups?      This comment is suggesting that, instead of trying to define an isomorphism by writing out a formula (as OP has attempted), they instead look at the multiplication tables (or, \"Cayley tables\") of the two groups in question. I assume the commenter hopes that \"structural similarities\" would be evident to the OP, when comparing the two multiplication tables, and that these similarities could be used in the quest for isomorphism.    So, the formula (which, presumably, doesn't work and consequently wouldn't be likely to help you understand either group) is one thing, and a multiplication table is another. The two aren't related, at least in this instance.     If you want to create a multiplication table for either group, I wouldn't expect any sort of formula to help (other than formulas defining the group operation).  Note : for some groups, one may well find formulas that help in writing down a multiplication table ( dihedral groups , for instance; see the last few lines in the linked section) but I wouldn't expect such a thing here.

        "body": "Disclaimer:  I don't know the answer to the question \"how do I extend a matrix based Hermitian operator to a differential equation?\". I know the answers to the previous questions raised in the post, so, here they are.    Let us establish a few definitions. The notion of hermiticity is tied to the notion of an inner product. In general, for a complex vector space  V  if  \\langle-,-\\rangle:V \\times V \\to V  is a hermitian inner product then the hermitian adjoint of an operator  A: V \\to V  is defined to be another operator  A^\\dagger: V \\to V  that satisfies:   \\langle u, A(v) \\rangle = \\langle A^\\dagger(u), v \\rangle\\,.   for any choice of vectors  u, v \\in V .  A n operator $A$ is called hermitian if it is equal to its hermitian adjoint. In your example, given two vectors  V_1  and  V_2   (which are column matrices with complex entries), their inner product is defined as   \\langle V_2, V_1 \\rangle := V_2^\\dagger \\cdot V_1\\,. \\tag{ip1}  With respect to this inner product, hermitian adjoint of a matrix operator is the same as the transpose conjugate (denoted conveniently by  \\dagger ) of that matrix, since for any two column matrices  V_1  and  V_2  and any square matrix  A  that acts on these column matrices we get:   \\langle V_2, A \\cdot V_1 \\rangle = V_2^\\dagger \\cdot A \\cdot V_1 = (A^\\dagger \\cdot V_2) \\cdot V_1 = \\langle A^\\dagger \\cdot V_2, V_1 \\rangle\\,.   Therefore, with respect to the inner product (ip1), a matrix is hermitian if it satisfies  A^\\dagger = A , as you have mentioned.        how do I know in a differential equation if my operator is a hermitian or not      To know whether a differential operator is hermitian or not first you must establish a definition of a hermitian inner product on the complex vector space of functions (on which the differential operator acts).    Example:  As our complex vector space of functions, let us take the space of square integrable complex functions on  \\mathbb R  (such functions will be called \" L^2 \") and as our differential operator let us take  \\hat D:= \\frac{\\mathrm{d^2}}{\\mathrm{d x^2}}  where  x  is the coordinate on  \\mathbb R . We also need an inner product: for any two  L^2   f unctions $f$ and  g  we define their inner product as:   \\langle f, g \\rangle := \\int_{\\mathbb R} \\mathrm dx\\, f(x)^* g(x)\\,. \\tag{ip2}  Now we can find out what the hermitian adjoint of  \\hat D  is. Recall that  \\hat D^\\dagger  is an operator that satisfies  \\langle \\hat D^\\dagger f, g \\rangle = \\langle f, \\hat D g \\rangle  for any two arbitrary  L^2   f unctions $f$ and  g . Using the integration by parts twice we find:   \\langle f, \\hat D g \\rangle = \\int_{\\mathbb R} \\mathrm dx f(x)^* \\frac{\\mathrm{d^2} g(x)}{\\mathrm d x^2} = -\\int_{\\mathbb R} \\mathrm dx \\frac{\\mathrm df(x)^*}{\\mathrm d x} \\frac{\\mathrm{d} g(x)}{\\mathrm d x} = \\int_{\\mathbb R} \\mathrm dx \\frac{\\mathrm{d^2} f(x)^*}{\\mathrm d x^2} g(x) = \\langle \\hat D f, g\\rangle\\,.   Therefore we conclude that with respect to the inner product (ip2), the operator  \\hat D  satisfies  \\hat D^\\dagger = \\hat D , therefore, it is hermitian.    Edit:  Apart from the functions being  L^2  I am also assuming them to be at least twice differentiable so that I can define the action of  \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm dx^2} , I am also assuming that the functions have some boundary condition (such as vanishing at infinty) that allows me neglect the boundary terms coming from integration by parts.    Note that the differential operator  \\frac{\\mathrm d}{\\mathrm d x}  is  not  hermitian with respect to the inner product (ip2) since integration by parts now gives  \\langle f, \\frac{\\mathrm d}{\\mathrm d x} g \\rangle = -\\langle \\frac{\\mathrm d}{\\mathrm d x} f, g \\rangle . So the operator is in fact anti-hermitian:  \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm d}{\\mathrm dx}\\right)^\\dagger = -\\frac{\\mathrm d}{\\mathrm dx} .        and whether I will have quantized solutions whose inner products will be zero?      Your proof of orthogonality of eigenvectors of a hermitian operator holds in general. But whether the eigenvalues will be discrete (quantized) or not depends on the space on which the functions are defined. If the space is compact (such as a circle, or a finite interval (a.k.a. the infinite square well in quantum mechanics)) then the eigenvalues will be discrete, if the space is non-compact (such as  \\mathbb R  from the previous example) the eigenvalues will be continuous unless we impose some extra constraints on the functions to restrict to a space with discrete spectrum (eigenvalues) for the operator. You can only write operators as square matrices and vectors as column matrices if the operators have discrete spectrum.    Edit:  (Correction, as pointed out by Chappers in the comment) It is possible to have discrete eigenvalues for differential operators on noncompact spaces if the function space is restricted by strong enough boundary conditions (that allows to normalize them for example).        For example the schrodinger wave equation leads to quantized orthogonal solutions.      The differential operator in the (assuming time-independent) Schr\u00f6dinger equation, for a particle moving in a one dimensional space, is:   \\hat D_\\psi := -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\frac{\\mathrm d^2}{\\mathrm d^2 x} + V(x)\\,,   and the inner product of wave functions is exactly as we defined in (ip2). Therefore, if the potential  V(x)  is a real function, then the operator  \\hat D_\\psi  is hermitian, since we have already proved that the second derivative is hermitian and you can check that multiplication by a real function is hermitian as well. Hermiticity leads to orthogonal eigenvector. But once again, the eigenvalues are discrete if the space in which the paticle moves is compact, or if we impose normalizability which is usually assumed in physical scenarios.        how do I extend a matrix based Hermitian operator to a differential equation?      This seems too complicated for me, I'm afraid. The problem is to find a space on which there is some operator that acts on (perhaps a restricted set of) functions defined on that space and the eigenvalues of that operator coincides with the eigenvalues of the matrix. I can not say anything useful about how to proceed, sorry!  "

If we try to go backwards from  $a \\uparrow b$ , the \"trivial\" extension (letting down arrows represent negative up arrows, because why the heck not) is:  $$\\begin{align*} a \\;b & = a \\cdot b \\\\ a \\downarrow b & = a + b \\\\ a \\downarrow \\downarrow b & = \\text{see below} \\end{align*} \\\\ \\vdots$$  But I had trouble coming up with an expression for  $a \\downarrow \\downarrow \\downarrow b$ .    Maybe it doesn't exist. Alternatively, maybe there is a way of defining  $a \\; b$  (zero arrows) such that it does exist. So my question is:  Is there an extension of Knuth's up-arrow notation such that  $a \\downarrow^n b$  exists for all  $n \\geq 3$ ?     Edit : Welp, I messed this question up. I initially thought  $a \\downarrow \\downarrow b = a + 1$  was correct, but it is actually  $b + 1$ . So I thought I had an example of an extension when I did not. I have modified the question accordingly.   An extension would define  $a \\uparrow^n b$  for each  $n \\leq 0$  which satisfies the recursive definition of the notation.       Edit 2 : Okay, turns out  $a \\downarrow \\downarrow b = b + 1$  isn't correct either, as this would imply  $a \\downarrow b = a + b - 1$ . For example,  $4 \\downarrow 3 = 4 \\downarrow \\downarrow (4 \\downarrow \\downarrow 4) = 4 \\downarrow \\downarrow (4 + 1) = (4 + 1) + 1 = 6 = 4 + 3 - 1$ . But it is really close; perhaps we need an exception, such as  $$\\begin{align*} a \\downarrow \\downarrow b = \\begin{cases}b + 1 & \\text{if } a < b \\\\ b + 2 & \\text{if } a = b \\end{cases}\\end{align*}.$$  The case  $a > b$  does not show up when evaluating  $a \\downarrow b$ , but it will be need to be defined if we try to extend further to  $a \\downarrow \\downarrow \\downarrow b$ . For instance, we could abuse the fact that the case  $a > b$  is allowed to be anything, and let  $$a \\downarrow \\downarrow b = b + 1 + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{a}{b} \\right\\rfloor,$$  but finding  $a \\downarrow \\downarrow \\downarrow b$  may be intractable as a result.

Or is it okay to simply assume that in case $y$ is of type function, we will just use the function equality predicate that is subsequently defined?      You're right -- as written the definition 3.3.7 doesn't really work as a  definition , at least not in the sense the  f=g  can be viewed as an  abbreviation  for the definition: we couldn't ever finish unfolding the definition because there's no limit to how many functions returning functions returning functions, etc. we may need to deal with.    The usual way out of that dilemma is to reinterpret things such that 3.3.7 is an  axiom  instead of a definition.    In this view, the symbol  =  denotes a primitive concept that  has no definition . The world simply comes from the beginning with a relation that we write  = , and we then have some axioms that tells us some of how that relation behaves. In many cases the axioms will be strong enough that we can know for sure whether  a=b  or  \\neg(a=b)  for  a ny two given $a$ and  b , but they don't  promise  to fix it completely in all corner cases.    For example, if the world is not well-founded (I don't know if Tao's system has axioms to prevent this or not) there might be some objects  \\alpha  and  \\beta  such that  \\alpha  happens to be the unique function object with domain  \\{0\\}  and range  \\{\\beta\\}  (we can easily show that then  \\alpha(0)=\\beta ), and  \\beta  happens to the unique function with domain  \\{0\\}  and range  \\{\\alpha\\} . Then it would satisfy 3.3.7 equally well to claim  either  that  \\alpha=\\beta  or that  \\alpha\\ne\\beta .       The first paragraph of your attempt looks reasonable, assuming that \"determined by  X ,  Y , and  \\phi \" actually means something like, \"such that forall  x  and  y  it holds that  f(x)=y \\leftrightarrow x\\in X\\land y\\in Y\\land \\phi(X,Y) \".    The second paragraph is not really needed, if instead you elevate 3.3.7 to be an axiom in itself. It says that equality between  any pair of function  works in such-and-such way, this automatically tells us that  in particular  equality between functions determined by formulas work in that way too.    Note that there may be functions that are  not  defined by any property that we can write down. Your axiom tells us that there exist  at least  all the functions we can write down definitions for, but there may be more functions than that.    (In particular, if Tao gets to the  Axiom of Choice  at some point, it is usually phrased such that it asserts that function with certain properties  exist , without specifying completely what each of their values have to be).

Now we define by recursion hierarchy of formulas:      \\Pi^0_n  are formulas logically equivalent to a negation of a  \\Sigma^0_n  formula.   \\Delta^0_n  are formulas which are equivalent to both  \\Sigma^0_n  and  \\Pi^0_n  formulas.   \\Sigma^0_{n+1}  formulas are those logically equivalent to something of the form  \\exists y\\varphi(x,y)  where  \\varphi(x,y)  is a  \\Pi^0_n  formula.      Of course, there are nontrivial theorems here, that you can define the  \\Pi^0_n 's by universal quantifiers; that you can chalk a bunch of consecutive existential quantifiers into a single existential unbounded quantifier, and so on.    We often omit the superscript  0  and just write  \\Sigma_0  or  \\Delta_1  and so on. Now we say that a subset is  \\Sigma_n  (or  \\Pi_n  or  \\Delta_n ) if it is definable by a formula of that complexity.    Why this is different? Because bounded quantifiers are much much more than \"no quantifiers at all\". And we can express whole lot of stuff using bounded quantifiers. For example, the set of prime numbers is definable with a  \\Sigma_0  formula. Can you find a formula without any quantifiers that defines the set of all prime numbers?       Now, why  \\Delta_0\\subsetneq\\Delta_1 ? This is a non-trivial theorem, but there is a  \\Sigma_1  universal formula. Namely, a  \\Sigma_1  formula  \\varphi(x,y)  such that whenever  \\psi(x)  is a  \\Sigma_1  formula, there is some  y  such that  \\psi(x)\\leftrightarrow\\varphi(x,y) .    Using some  \\Delta_0  encoding of pairs we can show that this defines a  \\Sigma_1  subset of  \\Bbb N  which is not  \\Pi_1 . And this means exactly that this set is not  \\Delta_1 . Why is this important? Because if  \\Delta_0=\\Delta_1 , then you can show that in fact  \\Sigma_1=\\Pi_1 , and therefore this universal set cannot exist. But it does so...  "

        "body": "The question \"What is the domain of [some expression]\" is a poorly phrased question.  A function is defined, in part, by its domain.  If you are not told ahead of time what the domain (and codomain!) of a function is (are), then any answer is legit.  For example, the answer  \\{1, 2, \\pi, -10^{100}\\}  is a perfectly reasonable answer to the given question.  However, I am being cranky.  I presume that the question is meant to be read        What is the largest set of real numbers on which the expression     \\frac{2\\cdot\\frac{1}{x}}{8\\cdot\\frac{1}{x}+5}     defines a function?     After doing a bit of simplification, you seem to have noticed that   \\frac{2\\cdot\\frac{1}{x}}{8\\cdot\\frac{1}{x}+5} = \\frac{2}{5x+8}.   However, this equality holds only when both the left-hand side (LHS) and the right-hand side (LHS) are defined.  The two e x pressions are not defined for all of the same values (and, in fact, this is sufficient to show that the largest set of numbers on which the LHS defines a function is different from the largest set of real numbers on which the RHS defines a function).  The simplification step can be useful in other circumstances, but it isn't helpful for determining the maximal domain.   Finally, to get at the largest possible domain, note that the original expression is a fraction of fractions involving a variable $x$.  It will define a function as long as the fraction takes a well-defined value.  Typically, fractions take well-defined values whenever both their numerators and denominators are real numbers, and their denominators are nonzero.  Thus we have three questions to answer:      When is the numerator a real number?   When is the denominator a real number?   When is the denominator nonzero?      The numerator is a real number as long as  \\frac{1}{x}  is defined, which implies that  x\\ne 0 .  Similarly, the denominator is defined as long as  x\\ne 0 .  Thus we definitely know that  0  is not in the domain of the function defined by this expression.  Finally, note that   8\\cdot\\frac{1}{x} + 5 = 0 \\iff \\frac{1}{x} = -\\frac{5}{8} \\iff x = -\\frac{8}{5}.   Thus the fraction is undefined when  x = -\\frac{8}{5} , which implies that this value is not in the domain of the function.    We have shown that neither  0  nor  -\\frac{8}{5}  is in the domain of the function, but every other real number works (since all other real numbers satisfy the conditions addressed by the three questions above).  Therefore the domain of the function is the set of real numbers, minus those give above, i.e.   \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\left\\{ 0, -\\frac{8}{5} \\right\\} = \\left( -\\infty, -\\frac{8}{5} \\right) \\cup \\left(-\\frac{8}{5}, 0\\right) \\cup (0,\\infty).

What we should prove is  \\iint_Qf(x,y)\\;dx\\;dy=\\iint_A f(r\\cos \\theta,r\\sin \\theta)\\;r\\;dr\\;d\\theta\\tag{$*$}.    I will not give a rigorous proof, but I will tell you how a formal proof can be done according to the approach of C. H. Edwards in his book  Advanced calculus of several variables . Quoting this book:        The student has undoubtedly seen change of variables formulas such as  (*)  which  r esult from changes from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The appearance of the factor  $r$  in the formula is sometimes \"explained\" by mythical pictures, such as figure in the OP's post, in which it is alleged that  dA  is an \"infinitesimal\" rectangle with sides  dr  and  r\\;d\\theta , and therefore has area  r \\;dr\\; d\\theta . In this section we shall give a mathemtaically acceptable explanation of the origin of such factors in the transformation of multiple integrals from one coordinate system to another.       To start, let us \"remember\" three things about double integrals:    \\quad  (i) From the geometric interpretation of the double integral, if  X  is a very small region and  (x_0,y_0)  is some point in  X , then  \\iint_Xf(x,y)\\;dx\\;dy\\cong f(x_0,y_0) \\Delta X,  where  \\Delta X  is the area of  X .    \\quad  (ii) The double inte g ral of a function  $g$  over a rectangle  A\\subset\\mathbb{R}^2   can be written as a limit of Riemann sums:  \\iint_Ag(x,y)\\;dx\\;dy=\\lim_{\\mathcal{\\|\\mathcal{P}\\|}\\to0}\\sum_{i=1}^k g(x_i,y_i)\\Delta A_i,  where  \\mathcal{P}=\\{A_1,...,A_k\\}  is a partition of  A ,  (x_i,y_i)  is a point in  A_i  and  \\Delta A_i  is the area of  A_i . Thus, for a sufficiently fine partition,  \\sum_{i=1}^k g(x_i,y_i)\\Delta A_i\\cong\\iint_Xg(x,y)\\;dx\\;dy.    \\quad  (iii) In the integral notation,  (x,y)  is a dummy variable and thus  \\iint g(x,y)\\;dx\\;dy=\\iint g(r,\\theta)\\;dr\\;d\\theta.    Assume that we want to calculate the double integral  \\iint_Q f(x,y)\\;dx\\;dy,\\tag{0}  where  Q  is an annular sector in  \\mathbb{R}^2  (see picture below).       We want to \"transform\" this integral into an integral over a rectangle. Why? Because we expect that the \"transformed integral\" will be easier to compute (by virtue of Fubini's theorem).    Note that the rectangle  A=\\{(r,\\theta)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2\\mid a\\leq r\\leq b\\text{ and }\\alpha\\leq \\theta\\leq\\beta \\}  is transformed into the annular sector  Q  by the mapping  T:\\mathbb{R}^2\\to\\mathbb{R}^2  given by  T(r,\\theta)=(r\\cos\\theta,r\\sin\\theta).\\tag{1}       So,  Q=T(A).\\tag{2}    We shall see that the mapping  T  can be used to transform  (0)  into an integral over the rectangle  A , as we want. For this, we have to answer the        Big question:  Given a rectangle  R , what is the relationship between the area  \\Delta R  of  R  and the area  \\Delta T(R)  of  T(R) ?      Answer:  Look at the picture above. If  (c,d)  is the center-point of  A , then  \\text{area of } Q=\\frac{b^2(\\beta-\\alpha)}{2}-\\frac{a^2(\\beta-\\alpha)}{2}=\\frac{1}{2}(b+a)(b-a)(\\beta-\\alpha)=c(\\text{area of } A)  The same is true for  R  and thus  \\Delta T(R)=p\\Delta R,\\tag{3}  where  p  is the abscissa of the center-point of  R .    Now, let  \\mathcal{P}=\\{A_1,..., A_k\\}  be a partition of  A  into very small subintervals. For each  i=1,...,k , let  (x_i,y_i)  be the center-point of  A_i . Then,  T(x_i,y_i)  is a point in  T(A_i)  and  Q=T(A_1)\\cup\\cdots \\cup T(A_k).\\tag{4}  with disjoint union. It follows that  \\begin{align} \\iint_Qf(x,y)\\;dx\\;dy&=\\iint_{T(A)} f(x,y)\\;dx\\;dy\\tag{by (2)}\\\\\\\\ &=\\sum_{i=1}^k\\iint_{T(A_i)} f(x,y)\\;dx\\;dy\\tag{by (4)}\\\\\\\\ &\\cong\\sum_{i=1}^k f(T(x_i,y_i))\\Delta T(A_i)\\tag{by (i)}\\\\\\\\ &=\\sum_{i=1}^kf(T(x_i,y_i))x_i\\Delta A_i\\tag{by (3)}\\\\\\\\ &\\cong \\iint_A (f(T(x,y))\\;x\\;dx\\;dy\\tag{by (ii)}\\\\\\\\ &=\\iint_A f(x\\cos y,x\\sin y)\\;x\\;dx\\;dy\\tag{by (1)}\\\\\\\\ &=\\iint_A f(r\\cos \\theta,r\\sin \\theta)\\;r\\;dr\\;d\\theta\\tag{by (iii)} \\end{align}    By now, working with one sufficiently fine partition, we have deduced that  \\iint_Qf(x,y)\\;dx\\;dy\\cong\\iint_A f(r\\cos \\theta,r\\sin \\theta)\\;r\\;dr\\;d\\theta.  However, with an \"epsilon argument\" it is possible to prove that we can make this approximation as good as we want and thus the equality  (*)  is indeed true (the details are made in the book). Quoting the said book again, the proof of  (*)        is a matter of supplying enough epsilonics to convert the above discussion into a precise argument.    "

        "body": "To not load the question with too much text, I decided to add my discoveries as an answer, though very lacking it may be.  However, these results are simple and have no references.  I would greatly appreciate if you find any mistake, if you can add anything to this, or if you make some comments.  My answer here is still loaded with many questions.           Proposition:   For a fixed integer  k>0 , there exists a commutative topological ring of characteristic  k>0  with a Haar measure.        Let  R_1,R_2,\\ldots,R_m  be topological rings with Haar measures  \\lambda_1,\\lambda_2,\\ldots,\\lambda_m  corresponding to left multipliers  l_1,l_2,\\ldots,l_m .  Define  R:=\\bigoplus\\limits_{i=1}^m\\,R_i ,  \\lambda:=\\bigotimes\\limits_{i=1}^m\\,\\lambda_i , and  l:=\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^m\\,\\left(l_i\\circ \\pi_i\\right) , where  \\pi_i:R\\to R_i  is the canonical projection.  Then, under the product topology,  R  is a topological ring with Haar measure  \\lambda  with respect to the  l eft multiplier $l$.  Hence, if  k_i:=\\text{char}\\left(R_i\\right) , then the characteristic of  R  is  \\text{lcm}\\left(k_1,k_2,\\ldots,k_m\\right) .  In particular, we  k now that there exists a ring of a given prime characteristic which possesses a Haar measure, so that there is a ring of a characteristic  k  which has a Haar measure, where $k$ is a square-free positive integer.  It is therefore left to find a ring of characteristic  p^j  with  p  being prime and  j>1  that possesses a Haar measure.    Now, let  R:=\\Big(\\mathbb{Z}\\big/\\left(p^j\\,\\mathbb{Z}\\right)\\Big)[\\![T]\\!] .  Each  f(T)\\in R  can be written as  p\\,f_0(T)+f_1(T) , where  f_0(T),f_1(T)\\in R  and the nonzero coefficients of  T^i  in  f_1(T)  are not divisible by  p .  Let  \\lambda  be the Haar measure of the group  (R,+) , which is compact and so we can assume  \\lambda(R)=1 .  Let  l(f):=l\\left(f_1\\right)  for all  f(T)\\in R ,  l(f):=1  if  f(T)  is an invertible element of  R ,  l(0):=0 , and  l(T):=\\frac{1}{p^j} .  Extend the definition of  l  onto  R  using the multiplicativity condition.  Then,  R  as a ring has a Haar measure  \\lambda  with respect to the  l eft multiplier $l$ (which is also a right multiplier).  Ergo, there exists a topological ring of characteristic  p^j  with a Haar measure.    Now, how about simple rings with Haar measures?  We know that the characteristic of a simple ring is either  0  or a prime integer.  Then, for a fixed prime  p\\in\\mathbb{N} , does there exist a sim p le topological ring of characteristic $p$ with a left, right, or two-sided Haar measure?  (For the case of rings of characteristic  0 ,  \\text{Mat}_{n\\times n}(\\mathbb{R})  and  \\text{Mat}_{n\\times n}(\\mathbb{C})  are simple topological rings with Haar measures.)           Proposition:   Any ring with a left, right, or two-sided Haar measure is uncountable.        If  R  is a countable nonzero ring, then  \\left\\{0_R\\right\\}  must be of zero measure, so that  R=\\bigcup_{r\\in R}\\,\\big(r+\\left\\{0_R\\right\\}\\big)  has zero measure, but this contradicts positivity of Haar measures of the group  (R,+) .  Hence, the only countable ring with a Haar measure is the zero ring  \\{0\\} , which is the unique ring of characteristic  1 , with the counting  m easure and the  two-sided multiplier  (or simply the  multiplier ) $m$ with  m(0):=1 .    Here is another trivial example.  A trivial ring (i.e., a ring with trivial multiplication) is a ring with Haar measure.  For an uncountable trivial ring  R  and a Haar measure  \\lambda  of the group  (R,+) , we can define the  m ultiplier $m$ as  m(x):=0  for all  x\\in R .           Proposition:  For any finite group  G , the group algebra  \\mathbb{C}[G]  equipped with the standard topology of  \\mathbb{C}^{|G|}\\cong \\mathbb{C}[G]  (again,  \\cong  means \"is homeomorphic to\") is a unimodular ring with a Haar measure.      This result is due to the Artin-Wedderburn Theorem.  That is,  \\mathbb{C}[G]  decomposes as the direct sum  \\bigoplus\\limits_{V\\,\\text{ irrep}}\\,\\left(V\\underset{\\mathbb{C}}{\\otimes} V^*\\right)  of two-sided ideals  V\\underset{\\mathbb{C}}{\\otimes} V^*  where  V  runs over all the (non-isomorphic) simple  \\mathbb{C}[G] -modules and  V^*  is its algebraic dual.  Since  V\\underset{\\mathbb{C}}{\\otimes} V^*  is isomorphic (and homeomorphic) to the ring  \\text{Mat}_{\\dim_\\mathbb{C}(V)\\times \\dim_\\mathbb{C}(V)}(\\mathbb{C})  for any finite-dimensional  \\mathbb{C} -vector space  V , the claim follows.    Similarly,  \\mathbb{R}[G]  is also a unimodular ring for any finite group  G .  The Artin-Wedderburn Theorem can also be used here to show that  \\mathbb{R}[G]  decomposes as a direct sum of two-sided ideals of the form  \\text{Mat}_{n\\times n}(\\mathbb{R})  or  \\text{Mat}_{n\\times n}(\\mathbb{C}) .      On the other hand, if  \\mathbb{F}  is a finite field and  G  is a Lie group, then what can we say about  \\mathbb{F}[G] ?  Is there a way to equip  \\mathbb{F}[G]  with a \"nice\" topology, \"compatible\" with that of  G ?  If so, under this topology, is  \\mathbb{F}[G]  a ring with a left, right, or two-sided Haar measure?       Under the usual topology of the quaternion skew-field  \\mathbb{H}\\cong\\mathbb{R}^4 ,  \\mathbb{H}  equipped with the Lebesgue measure is a unimodular ring with a Haar measure.  Its multiplier is given by  x\\mapsto |x|^4  for all  x\\in\\mathbb{H} .  One can also verify that  \\mathbb{H}[T]/\\left(T^n\\,\\mathbb{H}[T]\\right)  is a unimodular ring.  Now, I speculate that  \\text{Mat}_{n\\times n}(\\mathbb{H})  too is a unimodular ring, whilst  \\text{Mat}_{n\\times n}(\\mathbb{H})\\times\\mathbb{H}^n  (better denoted by  \\text{Mat}_{n\\times n}(\\mathbb{H})\\,{\\supset\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!+}\\,\\mathbb{H}^n ) is non-unimodular.  (Maybe somebody with more experiences in handling  \\mathbb{H}  can help me with my claims.)  What can we say about  \\mathbb{H}[G]  for a finite group  G ?        Definition:  A  symmetric subset   S  of a ring  R  is a subset  S  of  R  such that  x\\cdot S=S\\cdot x  for all  x\\in R .

In your original question, stipulating that  K  is a field is just a kludgy way to get it to have identity. Since  R  and  K  are both domains (in the sense I mentioned above) then both of them only have two idempotents: they must share two elements  0  and  1  which act as the additive and multiplicative identities in both rings, thanks to the lemma above.        Corollary   (enhanced rewritten version of question)  If  R  is a commutative domain and  K  is a subring with nonzero identity, then  R  has identity, and it is the same as  K 's.      F or a counterexample, you could consider a field $F$ and  R=F\\times F  where you have the subring  \\{0\\}\\times F  (isomorphic to  F ) with identity  1_K=(0,1)\\neq (1,1)=1_R .  "

        "body": "Here's my stab at this very philosophical question. Feel  f ree to edit and improve my answer as you wish. I have taken two different approaches to coming up with a description of functions satisfying your conditions.    Expressing $f$ as a function of two variables    From the first property, the directional derivative in the direction  \\mathbf{u} = \\langle 1, 1, 1 \\rangle  is 0 across the entire function's domain of  \\mathbb R_{>0}^3 . Expressed as an equation, this fact is    \\begin{align} D_{\\langle 1, 1, 1 \\rangle}f(x, y, z) = 0 = \\nabla f(x, y, z) \\cdot \\langle 1, 1, 1 \\rangle. \\tag{1} \\end{align}    Geometrically, I would argue then that each point in the domain o f  $f$ has only one corresponding \"projected\" point  (a, b)  on the  xy -plane, for which the two points are connected by some multiple of  \\langle 1, 1, 1 \\rangle . Algebraically, the following calculation confirms this suspicion:    \\begin{equation} \\langle x, y, z \\rangle = \\langle a, b, 0 \\rangle + t\\langle 1, 1, 1 \\rangle = \\langle a + t, b + t, t \\rangle \\end{equation}   z = t \\longrightarrow a = x - z; b = y - z    So we have a mapping  m : \\mathbb R^3 \\rightarrow \\mathbb R^2  projecting points in  f 's domain onto the  xy -plane. Therefore, we can more generally represent the function as a function  g(a, b)  of two variables. Specifically,    f(x, y, z) = g(a, b) = g(x - z, y - z), \\text{where } x, y, z > 0.    Here, to satisfy condition 4, we also impose that  g 's ran g e is strictly positive and  g  is continuous. Additionally, $g$ must input and return in meters to satis f y condition 3.    An alternate partial derivatives interpretation    Alternately, notice that in the equation (1) above, the sum of the partial derivatives must sum to 0 to satisfy property 1. So another general description of a function satisfying property 1 is a continuous, differentiable function $f$ for which    f_x(x, y, z) + f_y(x, y, z) + f_z(x, y, z) = 0    on its domain of  \\{x, y, z \\in \\mathbb R^3 : x, y, z > 0\\} . Additionally, as be f ore, we impose the constraint that $f$ is in meters (condition 3) and  f(x, y, z) > 0  throughout  f 's domain (condition 4).  "

If  K = F  or  K = F(u) , we're done; so assume that  K  has, at minimum, two generators over  F .    Firstly, we claim that we can always write  K = F(u, \\beta)  for some pair of elements  u,\\beta\\in K  that are both transcendental over  F , and where moreover,  \\beta  is separable over  F(u) . We'll show this fact in a moment, but for now, we'll prove  \\beta  is separable over  F(u)  in the case of two generators.    Note that we must have a polynomial  f\\in F[X,Y]  for which  f(u,\\beta) = 0 , due to the transcendence degree being  1 . WLOG assume  f  is irreducible.    Finally, note that since  F[X^p,Y^p] = \\left(F[X,Y]\\right)^p  where  p  is the characteristic of  F , it must be the case that  f\\not\\in F[X^p,Y^p] , as it is irreducible. Hence, one of  f(u, Y)  or  f(X, \\beta)  is a separable polynomial. This follows from the fact that inseparable polynomials must be of the form  \\sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^{p^i},    and up to relabeling, the conclusion is proved in the case of  K = F(u, \\beta).    We  n ow reduce to this case.    We proceed by induction on $n$. The base case of  n=2  has been proved above.    Assume  K = F(x_1,\\ldots, x_n)  for some  n \\geq 3 . Then, there exist  y,\\gamma\\in K  such that  F(x_1,\\ldots, x_{n-1}) = F(y, \\gamma)  with  \\gamma  separable over  F(y)  by the inductive hypothesis.

Hence,  K = F(u)(\\beta',\\gamma) , and one may then use the primitive element theorem to find an element  \\beta  such that  K = F(u)(\\beta) = F(u, \\beta) , proving the claim.

An infinite product  \\prod b_n  where  b_n:= 1+ a_n , is said to be an  absolutely convergent infinite product   if   \\prod ( 1 + |a_n| )  converges.        Observation:  Suppose  \\prod a_n  is conergent. We have  \\hat{p}_m   exists for all  m\\in \\mathbb{N}  by definition.

By applying first proposition, we deduce the result. As a corollary if  \\prod b_n  converges absolutely then  \\sum |a_n|   converges,  \\sum \\log (1+ a_n)   converges absolutely, and  \\prod b_n  converges.       Example:  In the case of proving identity    \\frac{\\zeta^2(s)}{\\zeta(2s)} = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^{v(n)}}{n^s}, \\, ( \\sigma > 1 )   we have the infinite product,    \\prod _p (1 + a_p) =  \\prod_p  ( 1 + 2p^{-s} + 2 p^{-2s} + \\cdots )   Where  a_p = 2( \\sum_{n =1 }^\\infty  p^{-ns} )  .

This class of groups is axiomatized by universally quantified first-order sentences.

For example, in the proof that, for every non-negative integers  $a, b$ , there exist integers  $q, r: a = bq + r$  (with the known restrictions on r), and the proof starts like this:  $Choose$  the largest integer  $q : qb <= a$ ... blah blah blah.

In fact, because this special case implies the general case it is pretty inconceivable to me how this could be proved by induction. The special case  a = 1  can be proved in a si m pler way, using the $m$-th cyclotomic polynomial, so you have a theorem with a single parameter in it, and I've never seen a proof of that version by induction either.    2) For  n \\geq 2 , the partial sums  H_n = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + \\cdots + 1/n  are not integers.     The proofs I know are based on studying the highest power of  2  less tha n  or equal to  n  rather than any kind of direct induction on $n$. If  H_n  is not an integer how can that raw fact help you show  H_{n+1}  is  n ot an integer? To use induction you'd be trying to show a \"non-property\" persists from $n$ to  n+1  (or from all integers from  2  to  n  on to  n+1 ). If someone says that the proof is by induction on the highest power of  2  less tha n  or equal to   n  then I'd point out that the proof does not  use  anything about $n$ to get the result for  n+1 .    3) A partial example: for  n \\geq 2 , the number  \\sqrt[n]{2}  is irrational.      I consider this partial because, while the direct statement is not easily accessible to induction (the numbers  \\sqrt[n]{2}  and  \\sqrt[n+1]{2}  are linearly disjoint over  \\mathbf Q , so it's hard to imagine how, to a beginner, the irrationality of  \\sqrt[n]{2}  could help you prove irrationality of  \\sqrt[n+1]{2} ), it could be seen as a consequence of the more general result that if a prime -- or just the specific prime  2  -- divides a product of  n  integers then it must divide one of them, and  that  is provable by induction.    4) Consider giving the class some unsolved problems about integers, e.g., for every  n \\geq 2  the infinite series  1 + 1/2^n + 1/3^n + 1/4^n + \\dots  is irratio n al.

(I use  \\leq  instead of  <  so the result is true all the way down to  n = 1 .)     More ge n erally, lots of theorems about the location of prime numbers are not accessible to proofs by induction (so far) since primality is not really a condition that respects the passage from $n$ to  n+1 .    6) Lagrange's four-square theorem: every integer  n \\geq 1  is a sum of four perfect squares.

How do we show  any  subset of  G  is  a  su b group? There are three steps: the subset should be non-empty, the subset should be closed under products, and the subset should be closed under inverses. What do I mean by closure under products? I mean that if $a$ and $b$ are in the subset, then  ab  is in the subset. Wh a t do I mean by closure under inverse? I mean that if $a$ is in the subset, then  a^{-1}  is in the subset.    So now let's look at our particular subset  A . We need to show three things:  A  is not the empty set,  A  is closed under products, and  A  is closed under inverses. The important thing to remember throughout this is  what does it mean to be an element of  A  ? An element  x\\in G  is an element of this subset  A , by definition, if  xHx^{-1}=H .    Now, to see that  A  is not empty, notice that  eHe^{-1}=eHe=H  wh e re $e$ is the identity element in  G . The equality on the line above exactly means that  e\\in A , so  A  is not the empty set.    Next we show that  A  is closed under products. Take  a, b\\in A . Then  aHa^{-1}=H  and  bHb^{-1}=H  as you noted in your original post. So  (ab)H(ab)^{-1}=abHb^{-1}a^{-1}=a(bHb^{-1})a^{-1}=aHa^{-1}=H  and this means that  ab\\in A .    Lasty, we show that  A  is closed under inverses. Take  a\\in A . Then  aHa^{-1}=H . Multiplying this equ a tion on the right by $a$ gives  aH=Ha ; multipling this equation on the left by  a^{-1}  gives  H=a^{-1}Ha . But recall that  a=(a^{-1})^{-1} . So this last equation can be rewritten:  H=a^{-1}H(a^{-1})^{-1}  which means that  a^{-1}\\in A .    Thus,  A  is non-empty, closed under products, and closed under inverses. So we conclude that  A  is a subgroup of  G .  "

How many numbers five digit numbers are there, well the short answer is 100,000 and we can arrive at this by saying that we have 10 choices for the first digit, and 10 for the second, etc to find that we have  10^5=100,000  numbers. But hang on, some of these are numbers like 000100 which isn't in our range, what restrictions do we have? Well at least one of the first two numbers has to be non zero, so we only have 99 choices for the first two ( 10^2=100 ,  -1  for the option 00) So we have 99 choices for the first two digits, and then  10^3  choices for the next three giving us  99*10*10*10=99,000 . Hurray, we have what we expected, 100,000-1000 is is 99,000.    Whilst that isn't ground breaking, we can add some details in. Instead of 10 choices for each digit, we don't want a 2,7,8 (anywhere) so we actually only have 7 choices for each digit. Also, we still need one of the first two digits to be non zero, so we have  7*7 -1  choices for the first digit, and then  7^3  for the remaining 3 digits, this gives  48*343=16464  numbers. There are some edge cases here, this includes the number 1000 but not 100,000.     On a smaller scale, how many numbers between 10 and 100 are there without a 2,7 or 8. Again we need the first digit to be non zero so we have 6 choices, and the second digit we have 7 choices. Giving us 42.

Now, we are assuming that  \\frac mn  are in \"lowest terms\"; that is  m,n  have no factors in common.  And we are assuming that  r, s  have no facto r s  in common.    So my questions to you are:      If $r$ and $s$ have no factors in common, is it possible for  r^2  and  s^2  to have factor in common?  And if they have no factors in common is  \\frac {r^2}{s^2}  in \"lowest terms\"?   Is it possible for a rational number to be expressed \"in lowest terms\" in two different ways?   If  \\frac {r^2}{s^2} = \\frac {m}{n}  is it possible that  m \\ne r^2 ?  Is it possible that  n \\ne s^2 ?      It seems we always take 2) for granted.  Maybe we need to concentrate on how to prove 2).    ======    There are basic things we take for granted.    1)  That a rational number can be written as a fraction between two integers.      That's actually a definition.    2) That every rational number has a  unique  way of being written \"in lowest terms\" as  w = \\frac mn  where  m,n  are i n tegers, than $n$ is positive (and  m   w ill be positive, negative, or zero if $w$ is), and that  m  a n d $n$ have no integer factors in common other than  1  (or in other words  \\gcd(m,n) = 1 ).    How do we  k now that every rational number has a  unique  expression in lowest terms?  Um.... Let me get back to you.    3) Unique prime factorization:  Every positive integer $k$ has a unique expression as a product of powers of primes.    Why?  Um... let me get back to you.    So this makes these question easy.  If  w = \\frac mn  is the  unique  expression in lo w est terms of rational $w$.  And if  \\sqrt{w}  is rational.  Then  \\sqrt = \\frac rs  where  \\frac rs  is the unique expression  in lowest terms  of  \\sqrt{w} .    So  \\sqrt{w} = \\frac rs    w = (\\frac rs)^2 = \\frac {r^2}{s^2} .      Now  r  and  s  have no factors in common.  So  r^2  and  s^2  have no factors in common.  So  w=\\frac {r^2}{s^2}  is in lowest terms.    But  w = \\frac mn  is  also  in lowest terms.  And the lowest terms expression is  unique .  So if  w = \\frac mn = \\frac {r^2}{s^2}  are both in lowest terms, then  m = r^2, n = s^2 .    Period.    That's it.    ...or... you can put it in terms of prime factors.    If  \\frac mn = \\frac {r^2}{s^2}  then  ms^2 = nr^2 .  If  p  is a pri m e factor of $m$ then  p|nr^2 .  So  p|n  or  p|r^2 .  But  p \\not \\mid n  because  m,n  are relatively prime.  So  p|r^2  so  p|r  so  p^2|r^2 .  So  p^2|nr^2  and  p^2|ms^2 .  So  p|\\frac mp s^2  so  p|\\frac mp  or  p| s^2 .  But  p\\not \\mid s^2  because  p|r  and  r,s  are relatively prime.  So  p|\\frac mp  so  p^2|m .      Repeat this for every pri m e factor of  m  and you will see that every pri m e factor divides $m$ and even number of times.  So $m$ is a perfect square and  m = r^2 .  Likewise  n = s^2 .    But you don't  have  to do this.  As \"lowest terms\" are  unique  and  \\frac mn = \\frac {r^2}{s^2}  are  m>both i n  lowest terms... $m$ and $n$  are   r^2  and  s^2 .  "

        "body": "A mathematical inequality, just like any other mathematical statement using a relation, can be either true or false based on a set of criteria. If the statement contains only numbers and no variables, then it is either true or false, definitively. For example, we always know that  0<2  is true, or  2<0  is false.    However, say we define a statement with a variable with a relation, like for example  x=2 . If I were to ask you if that statement were true, you'd probably be puzzled. What do I mean, is this true? What I'm really asking is, for what values of  x  is this statement true? Trivially, we can see that if  x  is 2, then the statement is true and if  x  is 3 or 4 or any other number, the statement is false.    We can e x tend this to  y our system of inequalities the e x act same wa y . We can't ask \"is this system true or false\" because the answer to that depends on our choices of  x  and  y . There are some values of $x$ and  y  that will make the given inequalities true, and there are some values of $x$ and $y$ that will make them false.    In this case, we can solve for $y$ and try to visualize the region of solutions. Here we find  y > x-3  and  y > \\dfrac{6-x}{2} . So then any point that is greater than those lines will satisfy either equation. When you graph the equation and found the overlapping areas of inequality, you find where both inequalities were true, and thus the system. Notice that there are some areas where no points work, this is where the values of  x  and  y  will produce false mathematical statements. For example,  x = 3 ,  y = -1  makes the system    \\begin{align*} -1 &> 3 \\quad \\text{False.} \\\\ -1 &> \\frac{3}{2} \\quad \\text{False.} \\end{align*}    It gets a little more complicated to find the areas with multiple variables and dimensions, but essentially the same principles hold. It is also useful to note that there are systems of equations (and inequalities) that are always true (eg.  y^2 \\geq 0, x^2 \\geq 0 ), and systems that are always false. (eg.  y > 0, y \\leq 0 .)

By algebraic, I'm talking about solving equations like  x^2 + 3y^2 = 5  or  x^2 - 47y^2 = 37 . An example question would be whether these equations have solutions in integers. The answer is that the first equation does not, while the latter has infinitely many (e.g.,  x = 15 ,  y = 2 ). Surprisingly, determining the former has no solutions can make use of imaginary numbers. You can try solving equations like these by just trying a whole bunch of values, which might not be so bad in the plus case, but can easily be trying in the minus case even if there are infinitely many solutions.    For someone with more geometric interests, I would go ahead and introduce the concept of the complex plane and numbers of the form  a + b \\sqrt{-d} , where  d  is  a  positive integer and $a$ and  b  are any integers (including  0 ). You can't really do greater than or less than on these numbers, but you can compare how far these numbers are from  0 . An example question would be which of  -7 + 5 \\sqrt{-2}  and  12 - \\sqrt{-2}  is closer to  0 , and what part the Pythagorean theorem plays in this.    For someone more interested in the historical aspect of it, I suppose it comes down to the romance of Fermat's last theorem, \"a simple knot tied by a part-time French mathematician working alone without a computer\" and not untied quite to the satisfaction of a French space captain in the age of truly ubiquitous computers.    There is also the number theoretic perspective, for questions such as what prime numbers can be solutions to an equation like  x^2 - 10y^2 .

The task is to get to the heart of the situation, and then its simple counting.    I'm assuming that the two groups are labeled  1  and  2 .    Group  1  m a y take $a$ balls of type  A  and  b  balls of Type  B  under the sole conditions that   0\\leq a\\leq 2n,\\quad 0\\leq b\\leq 2n,\\quad n\\leq a+b\\leq 3n\\ ;\\qquad(*)  finally group  1  should take as many balls of type  C  as are needed to make a total of  3n . When this has been done group  2  should t a ke all the remaining  b alls.    It follows that there are just two degrees of freedom: The choice of $a$ and $b$, whereby the restrictions  (*)  apply. In order to count the number of possibilities satisfying  (*)  we draw an  (a,b) -plane and shade the  (a,b) -domain  F  where all six inequalities  (*)  are fulfilled. Here is the figure:        Now we have count the number of integer points in  F . The square  Q:=[0,2n]^2  contains  (2n+1)^2  lattice points, and each of the small triangles in the lower left and upper right corners of  Q  contains  1+2+\\ldots+n={n(n+1)\\over2}  lattice points. Therefore the number  f(n)  of feasible lattice points  (a,b)  is given by  f(n)=(2n+1)^2 -2{n(n+1)\\over2}=3n^2+3n+1\\ .  In particular  f(1)=7 , as can be easily verified by going through the cases.  "

Proof  It suffices to prove that, for an arbitrary covering  \\mathcal U =(U_i)_{i\\in I}  we have   \\check H^1(\\mathcal U,\\underline A)=0 .  Given a cocycle  (g_{ij})\\in  Z^1(\\mathcal U,\\underline A) , fix some  i_0\\in I  and define the  0 -cochain  (h_i)\\in  C^0(\\mathcal U,\\underline A)  by  h_i=g_{i_0i} .  The cocycle condition  g_{i_0j}=g_{i_0i}+g_{ij}  translates into  h_j=h_i+g_{ij}  or  g_{ij}=h_j-h_i .  This proves that the cocycle  (g_{ij})  is the coboundary of the cochain  (h_i) , and thus  that the class of that  cocycle is zero in   \\check H^1(\\mathcal U,\\underline A) .  Since  (g_{ij})  was an arbitrary cocycle, we have    \\check H^1(\\mathcal U,\\underline A)=0 , as promised.      Check your understanding  Where on earth did I use that our  sheaf is constant and that  X  is irreducible ?!   Edit: Answer  When I defined  h_i=g_{i_0i} .  Since  g_{i_0i}\\in \\Gamma(U_{i_0i},\\underline A)  and  h_i\\in \\Gamma(U_i,\\underline A) ,  the definition    h_i=g_{i_0i}  only makes sense because  \\Gamma(U_i,\\underline A)=\\Gamma(U_{i_0i},\\underline A)=A .  See Remark 1) below where I emphasize that  \\Gamma(U,\\underline A)=A  for all open non-empty  U 's.    Remarks  1) The irreducibility of  X  implies that the constant  presheaf  associated to  A  is already a sheaf i.e. that the constant sheaf  \\underline A  is given by  \\Gamma(U,\\underline A)=A  for all open non-empty subsets  U\\subset X .  (For reducible topological spaces  \\Gamma(U,\\underline A)  consists of  locally constant   maps   U \\to A )  This implies that  \\underline A  is flabby (=flasque).  2) For arbitrary flabby sheaves  \\mathcal F   on arbitrary topological spaces  Y  both \u010cech cohomology groups and genuine cohomology  groups (as introduced by Grothedieck through derived functors)  are zero in all positive degrees :  \\check {H}^n(Y,\\mathcal F)=H^n(Y,\\mathcal F)=0  for  n\\gt 0 .  3) And to finish  on a pleasant note:  \u010cech cohomology groups and genuine cohomology  groups always coincide in degree  1  for all sheaves  \\mathcal G  of abelian groups, flabby or not:   \\check {H}^1(Y,\\mathcal G)=H^1(Y,\\mathcal G) .

Let  \\{f_n\\}  be a monotonically decreasing sequence of continuous functions such that  f_n(x) \\to f(x)  pointwise. Prove that  f_n(x) \\to f(x)  uniformly.     \\textbf{Proof:}  We want to show that  \\forall \\epsilon >0   \\exists N  such that  \\forall n \\ge N  and  \\forall x \\in K ,  |f_n(x) - f(x) | < \\epsilon      Let  g_n(x) = f_n(x) - f(x) . Then since  f_n(x) \\searrow f(x)  point wise we have that  g_n(x)  is a monotonically decreasing sequence of continuous function. Now let  \\epsilon > 0  be fixed but arbitrary. We want to show the existence  N  to satisfy the conditions of uniform convergence. Let,   E_n := \\{ x \\in K : g_n(x) = f_n(x) - f(x) < \\epsilon \\}  Then  E_n  is open because it is the pre image of the continuous functions  g_n(x) . Notice that  g_n(x)  is continuous as it is the difference of continuous functions. We claim that  E_n  is an ascending sequence of open sets. That is,   E_0 \\subset E_1 \\subset \\dots \\subset E_n \\subset \\dots  The sequence is ascending because  g_n(x)  is decreasing. That is if  x \\in E_n , then  g_n(x) < \\epsilon , but this implies that  g_{n+1} (x) < \\epsilon , and so  x \\in E_n  implies that  x \\in E_{n+1} . Now as  n \\to \\infty , we have that  g_n(x) \\to 0 . Since  g_n(x) = 0 < \\epsilon , we have that the sets of  x \\in K  such that  g_n(x) < \\epsilon  will eventually be all of  K .  Thus,   \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} E_n \\supset K  and so the above union is an open cover of  K . Since  K  is compact, there exists a finite subcover, such that,   \\bigcup_{n=1}^N E_n \\supset K  At this point, we should be happy as we have an appearance of  N . Remember we are looking for  N .  K \\subset \\bigcup_{n=1}^N E_n  implies that  \\forall x \\in K , we have that  |g_n(x)|= | f_n(x) - f(x)| < \\epsilon  Since  g_n(x)  is decreasing, this immediately gives us that  \\forall x \\in K ,  \\forall n > N ,  |f_n(x) - f(x)| < \\epsilon . Thus we have show  f_n(x)  converge to  f(x)  for arbitrary  \\epsilon  and so we are finished.   "

The n  $n$ is  p rime.    This proof splits into four steps:      We will prove that if $p$ divides  \\varphi(n) , the n  $n$ is prime.   We will prove that if  2^{2p} \\equiv 1 \\pmod n , then  p  divides  \\varphi(n) .   We will prove that if  2^{p^2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod n , then  p  divides  \\varphi(n) .   The  Lucas primality test  implies that if  2^{2p} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod n  and  2^{p^2} \\not\\equiv 1 \\pmod n , the n  $n$ is  p rime.      Lemma : Let $p$ be a prime and  n=2p^2+1 .  If  p  divides  \\varphi(n) , the n  $n$ is prime.    Proof :  Since  \\varphi(n)  is multi p licative and  p  is prime, $p$ divides  \\varphi(q^t)  for some prime power divisor  q^t  of  n .  Since  \\varphi(q^t)=q^{t-1}(q-1) , and  q  divides  n  while  p  does  n ot divide $n$, we must have that  p  divides  q-1 .    Since  q  divides  n , we know  n=bq  for some  b \\geq 1 .  Since  p  divides  q-1 , we know  q=cp+1  for some  c \\geq 1 .    Hence  n=b(cp+1)=bcp+b  and from before  n=2p^2+1.   By taking these equations modulo  p , we must have that  b \\equiv 1 \\pmod p .    Case I:  b \\geq 2p+1 .  Then  n=bcp+b>2p^2+1 , giving a contradiction.    Case II:  b=p+1 .  Then  n=cp(p+1)+p+1=cp^2+2cp+1 .  Si n c e $n$ is odd, we must have that $c$ is even, and thus  n>2p^2+1 , giving a contradiction.    Thus  b=1 , and hence  c=2p , and hence  q=2p^2+1=n .  He n ce $n$ is prime (since  q  is a prime divisor of  n ).   End proof.      Now assume  2^{2p} \\equiv 1 \\pmod n .  Then  4^p \\equiv 1 \\pmod n .  Since  \\gcd(4,n)=1 , we know  4  is a member of the group  (\\mathbb{Z}_n)^{\\times} .  Hence the order of  4 , which we will denote  o_4 , divides  |(\\mathbb{Z}_n)^{\\times}|=\\varphi(n) .  However, since  4^p \\equiv 1 \\pmod n , we know that  o_4  divides  p .  But since  n \\geq 19 , we know that  o_4>1 , so  o_4=p .  Hence  p  divides  \\varphi(n) .   Now assume  2^{p^2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod n .  Since  \\gcd(2,n)=1 , we know  2 \\in (\\mathbb{Z}_n)^{\\times} .  Hence the order  o_2  of  2  divides  |(\\mathbb{Z}_n)^{\\times}|=\\varphi(n) .  However, since  2^{p^2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod n , we know that  o_2  divides  p^2 .  But since  n \\geq 19 , we know that  o_2>1 , so  p  divides  o_2  (more specifically, we know  o_2 \\in \\{p,p^2\\} ).  Hence  p  divides  \\varphi(n) .    "

Clearly  $x \\leq x+ y$  and since both sides of the inequality are positive, the inequality  $x^k \\leq (x + y)^k$  will hold for  $k \\geq 1$ . Similarly,  $y^k \\leq (x+y)^k$ . Adding both inequalities together, we obtain:  $x^k + y^k \\leq 2(x+y)^k$ . While this is close, of course, it is not what we want to show.    Alternatively, I was thinking that if we fix  $x,y \\geq 0$ , let  $f(k) = (x+y)^k$ , and let  $g(k) = x^k + y^k$ , we can show using the binomial theorem that  $(x+y)^r \\geq x^r + y^r$  for all  $r \\in \\mathbb{Z^+}$ . Then, if we can show both  $f$  and  $g$  intersect only when  $k =1 $ , we might have better luck proving the statement since then we would have  $(x+y)^r > x^r + y^r$  for all positive integers  $r \\geq 2$ . A real number  $m \\notin \\mathbb{Z}$  with the property that  $f(m) = g(m)$  could not then exist since then that would violate the fact that  $k=1$  is the only intersection. We could then invoke the continuity of  $f$  and  $g$  together with the fact that  $(x+y)^r > x^r + y^r$  for all positive integers  $r \\geq 2$  to obtain our result. Of course, all of this is dependent on rigorously showing that  $f$  and  $g$  intersect only when  $k=1$ .    Otherwise, I'm running low on ideas. Any hints would be greatly appreciated.  ",

Proof  for  theorem  : First, let us prove $a_{4m+1}\\gt b_{4m+1}$ for $m\\in\\mathbb N  by induction. In order to prove the  m=1$ case, it is sufficient to prove   \\begin{align}{\\pi}^{{\\pi}^e}\\gt e^{e^{\\pi}}(\\log\\pi)+\\log(\\log\\pi)\\qquad(2)\\end{align}  Now let us consider the following equation :   \\begin{align}\\log\\left(\\frac{{\\pi}^{{\\pi}^{e}}}{e^{e^{\\pi}}(\\log\\pi)}\\right)={\\pi}^e(\\log\\pi)-e^{\\pi}-\\log(\\log\\pi)\\qquad(3)\\end{align}  Now let us define a function $f(x)$ as the following :   f(x):=x^ee^{-x}(\\log x)\\ \\ (x\\in [e,\\pi])  Hence we get  f^{\\prime}(x)=x^{e-1}e^{-x}\\{1-(x-e)\\log x\\}.  By mean value theorem, there exists $\\xi\\in(e,\\pi)$ such that  \\begin{align}f(x)-f(e)=(\\pi-e)f^{\\prime}(\\xi)\\qquad(4)\\end{align}  Here, noting that $f(\\pi)={\\pi}^ee^{-\\pi}(\\log\\pi)  and that  f(e)=1 ,  (4)$ tells us that   {\\pi}^e\\log\\pi-e^{\\pi}=e^{\\pi}(\\pi-e)e^{-\\xi}{\\xi}^{e-1}\\{1-(\\xi-e)\\log\\xi\\}\\gt(\\pi-e)\\cdot 1\\cdot e^{e-1}\\{1-(\\pi-e)\\log\\pi\\}.  Here, since $0\\lt \\pi-e\\lt 3.2-2.7=\\frac 12$, lemma 1 tells us that   {\\pi}^e\\log\\pi-e^{\\pi}\\gt e\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{e}-1\\right)\\cdot 2\\left(1-\\frac 12\\cdot\\frac{\\pi}{e}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{e}-1\\right)(2e-\\pi)\\gt (\\log\\pi-1)(2e-\\pi).  Then, noting that $\\log\\pi-1=e^{\\log(\\log\\pi)}-1\\gt (1+\\log(\\log\\pi))-1=\\log(\\log\\pi)  and that  2e-\\pi\\gt 2\\times 2.7-3.2=2.2\\gt 2$, we get  \\begin{align}{\\pi}^e\\log\\pi-e^{\\pi}\\gt 2\\log(\\log\\pi)\\qquad(5)\\end{align}  Hence, $(3)(5)$ tells us that  \\log\\left(\\frac{{\\pi}^{{\\pi}^e}}{e^{e^{\\pi}}(\\log\\pi)}\\right)\\gt 2\\log(\\log\\pi)-\\log(\\log\\pi)=\\log(\\log\\pi).  Hence, since   {\\pi}^{{\\pi}^{e}}\\gt e^{e^{\\pi}}(\\log\\pi)e^{\\log(\\log\\pi)}\\gt e^{e^{\\pi}}(\\log\\pi)(1+\\log(\\log\\pi))\\gt e^{e^{\\pi}}\\log\\pi+\\log(\\log\\pi),  we know that the $m=1  case is proven.    Now suppose that a_{4m+1}\\gt b_{4m+1}  for some  m\\ge 1$. Then, lemma 3 tells us that   {\\pi}^{{\\pi}^{e^{e^{b_{4m+1}}}}}\\lt e^{e^{{\\pi}^{{\\pi}^{a_{4m+1}}}}}.  Hence, since   b_{4m+5}={\\pi}^{b_{4m+4}}={\\pi}^{{\\pi}^{a_{4m+3}}}={\\pi}^{{\\pi}^{e^{a_{4m+2}}}}={\\pi}^{{\\pi}^{e^{e^{b_{4m+1}}}}},  we get $b_{4m+5}\\lt a_{4m+5} .     Now we can prove that a_{4m+1}\\gt b_{4m+1}  for any  m\\in\\mathbb N .    Noting that \\log\\pi\\gt 1$, we get  a_{4m}=\\log e^{a_{4m}}=\\log a_{4m+1}\\gt \\log b_{4m+1}=\\log {\\pi}^{b_{4m}}=b_{4m}\\log\\pi\\gt b_{4m}.  Also, we get  a_{4m+2}=e^{b_{4m+1}}\\lt {\\pi}^{b_{4m+1}}\\lt {\\pi}^{a_{4m+1}}=b_{4m+2},  and   a_{4m+1}=e^{a_{4m+2}}\\lt {\\pi}^{a_{4m+2}}\\lt {\\pi}^{b_{4m+2}}=b_{4m+3}.  Hence, we now know that the proof of theorem is completed.  "

Again, basic facts about Gauss sums imply that  \\zeta_5 + \\zeta_5^{-1} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} , so it follows by the quadratic formula that  \\zeta_5 = \\frac{ 1 - \\sqrt{5} + i \\sqrt{10 + 2 \\sqrt{5}} }{4}.    In general one may need to take more than just square roots, in which case things get complicated. There will be expressions one can write down generalizing Gauss sums that are guaranteed to land in a specific subfield of  \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)  but I do n 't k n ow a good way of actually figuri n g out what those expressions are by hand, and in writing down Kummer extensions one may need to adjoin smaller roots of unity (so I believe the most important case is when $n$ is prime).     A basic remark is that the problem reduces to the case that $n$ is a power of a prime, since for arbitrary $n$ it is possible to write  \\zeta_n  as a product of roots of the form  \\zeta_{p^k}  where  p^k \\parallel n .

Also, for any point that lies beyond the red line (like  Y ), the intermediate point  B  maybe skipped for the same reason. In other words, for any problem instance that maximizes the shortest cycle, there may be no points like  X  or like  Y  (otherwise the instance could be modified so that shortest cycle could be made longer).

Again, basic facts about Gauss sums imply that  \\zeta_5 + \\zeta_5^{-1} = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} , so it follows by the quadratic formula that  \\zeta_5 = \\frac{ 1 - \\sqrt{5} + i \\sqrt{10 + 2 \\sqrt{5}} }{4}.    In general one may need to take more than just square roots, in which case things get complicated. There will be expressions one can write down generalizing Gauss sums that are guaranteed to land in a specific subfield of  \\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_n)  but I do n 't k n ow a good way of actually figuri n g out what those expressions are by hand, and in writing down Kummer extensions one may need to adjoin smaller roots of unity (so I believe the most important case is when $n$ is prime).     A basic remark is that the problem reduces to the case that $n$ is a power of a prime, since for arbitrary $n$ it is possible to write  \\zeta_n  as a product of roots of the form  \\zeta_{p^k}  where  p^k \\parallel n .

By the aforementioned fact it follows that  g  divides  f  in  \\Bbb{Q}(X) , but this is absurd because  f  is irreducible.

Edit : I add a proof of the above claim here. You can skip this if you know the proof.        To prove the equivalence, we consider the general case  a\\equiv b\\pmod n  and let  n=\\prod_{i=1}^{m}{p_i}^{k_i}  be the prime decompositio n  of $n$. Since  n\\mid a-b  and  {p_i}^{k_i}\\mid n  for each of  i=1,2,...,m , we immediately have  {p_i}^{k_i}\\mid a-b . This proves that the original congruence implies the system of congruences.        For the converse, suppose  {p_i}^{k_i}\\mid a-b  for each of  i=1,2,...,m . That is, we assume the system of congruences holds. Using  this theorem , since the prime powers are coprime, you can show inductively that the whole product divides  a-b . That is,  \\prod_{i=1}^{m}{p_i}^{k_i}\\mid a-b.  But the product is just equal to  n . So  n\\mid a-b . This proves that the system of congruences implies the original congruence.      We now simplify each of the congruences. It is easy to see that  3^{999^{100}}  is a multiple of  9 . Since  \\phi(9)=6 , and that  960  is a multiple of  6 , we have  7^{960^{961}}\\equiv 7^{6n}\\equiv 1\\pmod {9} , where  n=\\frac{960^{961}}{6}  is a positive integer.    For the second congruence, observe that  \\phi(25)=20 , and  999^{100}\\equiv (-1)^{100}\\equiv 1\\pmod{20} , so  999^{100}-1=20m , where  m=\\frac{999^{100}-1}{20}  is a positive integer. Then  3^{999^{100}}\\equiv 3^{20m+1}\\equiv 3\\pmod{25} .  960  is a multiple of  20 . So  7^{960^{961}}\\equiv 7^{20k}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{25} , where  k=\\frac{960^{961}}{20} . We have arrived at the system  \\begin{cases}a\\equiv 1\\pmod {9}\\\\\\\\a\\equiv 4\\pmod {25}\\end{cases}.  You can solve this by Chinese Remainder Theorem.  "

Are the two point supposed to be on the ellipse? If so, then $h$ and $\\alpha$ cannot be determined, because there can multiple ellipses at the origin containing the same two points. (Quick proof: draw a (non-circular) ellipse  E  at the origin. Rotate it by 30 degrees to get another ellipse  E' . Now look at  E \\cap E' . It will typically contain four points. If any two of these are called  A  and  B , then both  E  and  E'  are possible solutions to t h e \"find $h$ and  \\alpha \" problem, but the  \\alpha  values for  E  and  E'  differ by 30 degrees.     Post-comment remarks    The squared distance from  (x(t), y(t))  to  (0,0)  is  \\begin{align} d(t)^2  &= \\left[\\cos(\\alpha) \\cos(t)  - h\\sin(\\alpha) \\sin(t)\\right]^2        +  \\left[\\sin(\\alpha) \\cos(t) + h\\cos(\\alpha) \\sin(t)\\right]^2 \\\\ &= \\cos^2(\\alpha) \\cos^2(t)  + h^2\\sin^2(\\alpha) \\sin^2(t)     - 2h\\cos(\\alpha) \\cos(t)\\sin(\\alpha) \\sin(t)         +  \\sin^2(\\alpha) \\cos^2(t) + h^2\\cos^2(\\alpha) \\sin^2(t)    + 2h\\cos(\\alpha) \\cos(t)\\sin(\\alpha) \\sin(t) \\\\ &= (\\cos^2(\\alpha) +   \\sin^2(\\alpha)) \\cos^2(t)  + h^2(\\sin^2(\\alpha) + \\sin^2(t)) \\sin^2(t) \\\\ &= \\cos^2(t)  + h^2 \\sin^2(t)  \\end{align} This varies from  1  (at  t = 0 ) to  h^2  (at  t = \\frac{\\pi}{2} ). Hence one (semi-) axis has length  1  and t h e other has length $h$. If  h < 1 , then the major (semi-)axis will have length  1 .     Note that at  t = 0 , we have  $ \\begin{align} x(0) &= \\cos(\\alpha) \\cos(0)  - h\\sin(\\alpha) \\sin(0) &= \\cos(\\alpha) \\ y(0) &= \\sin(\\alpha) \\cos(0) + h\\cos(\\alpha) \\sin(0) &= \\sin(\\alpha) \\end{align} which is an angle  \\alpha  from the positive  x$-axis, as required.     It's possible that you still don't believe me, so here's some Matlab code:    function y = ellipseTest() hList = [0.1, 0.3, 0.7];            % three different eccentricities alphaList = [20, 50, 130] * pi/180; % three different major-axis angles t = linspace(0, 2*pi, 100);         % sample values from 0 to 2pi colorList = ['r', 'g', 'b']; figure(gcf);  clf; hold on  for i = 1:3    h = hList(i); alpha = alphaList(i); color = colorList(i);      x = cos(alpha) * cos(t)  - h * sin(alpha) * sin(t);     y = sin(alpha) * cos(t)  + h * cos(alpha) * sin(t);      plot(x, y, color) end hold off; set(gca, 'DataAspectRatio', [1 1 1]); figure(gcf);     and the resulting figure:     I find these pretty compelling.     Note that each pair of ellipses intersects in two points in the first quadrant, so if you picked one of these sets-of-two-points for your part 2 question, you'd find two different ellipses that fit them.

        "body": "Why can't we simply translate a higher order logic sentence into first order set theory to test it for validity?      I want to focus on this (interesting!) confusion as to why the sentences of second-order arithmetic which are valid w.r.t full semantics need not be recursively enumerable even though everything takes place in a first-order ambient set theory whose provable sentences  are  recursively enumerable. I'm not an expert, so if anything's unprecise or  wrong, or if I in effect repeated the other answers without noting, please tell me.    Given a sentence  \\phi  in second-order arithmetic, its semantic truth in  \\textsf{ZFC}  is expressible as a first-order statement in the language of set theory. Call this statement  \\text{true}(\\phi)  and choose  \\text{true}(-)  in such a way that it is computable, and that moreover for any sentence  \\psi  in the language of set theory it is decidable as to whether it is of the form  \\text{true}(\\phi)  for some  \\phi  or not, with  \\phi  computable from  \\psi  in case it is. This allows for choosing an arbitrary recursive enumeration of the provable sentences  \\psi  of  \\textsf{ZFC}  and 'printing out' out  \\phi  in case  \\psi=\\text{true}(\\phi) . All in all this gives - in the finitistic metatheory - a recursive enumeration of some set of sentences of second-order arithmetic that feels like the set of true sentences (sloppyness intended).    Huh?! Isn't this in contradiction with        \\textsf{[ZFC]}  The set  \\textbf{T}  of true sentences of second-order arithmetic is  not  recursively enumerable.      To see that it is not, let's first make sure we are not comparing apples and oranges by having the seemingly contradictory statements live in the same formal system, i.e. let us internalize the above discussion in  \\textsf{ZFC}  itself. Then rereading it carefully, it shows that, within  \\textsf{ZFC} , we can enumerate the set  \\textbf{S}  of sentences  \\phi  of second-order arithmetic for which the (internalized) first-order theory  \\textsf{ZFC}  proves  \\text{true}(\\phi) . Now, applying (within  \\textsf{ZFC} ) Goedel's Completeness Theorem to the first-order theory  \\textsf{ZFC}  shows that these are precisely the sentences of second-order arithmetic which are valid for the natural numbers inside any model of  \\textsf{ZFC}  within  \\textsf{ZFC} .    This is a semantic notion of truth which is different from the natural one used for defining  \\textbf{T} !      For example, if we enhance the ambient theory  \\textsf{ZFC}  by  \\neg\\ \\text{Con}(\\textsf{ZFC}) ,  \\textbf{S}  consists of  all  sentences of second-order arithmetic, while (if  \\textsf{ZFC}  and hence also  \\textsf{ZFC} + \\neg\\ \\text{Con}(\\textsf{ZFC})  is consistent) this is not true for the set  \\textbf{T}  of true sentences of second-order arithmetic.

I would recommend you this approach as simpler than the one below.    Via homomorphisms:   Homomorphisms  are very useful operations, basically what they do is substitution, and context-free languages are closed under images of homomorphisms and their inverses (its not hard to imagine, that if you have a context-free grammar, then you can substitute each terminal with something else and still have a context-free grammar, right?).

Edit : I add a proof of the above claim here. You can skip this if you know the proof.        To prove the equivalence, we consider the general case  a\\equiv b\\pmod n  and let  n=\\prod_{i=1}^{m}{p_i}^{k_i}  be the prime decompositio n  of $n$. Since  n\\mid a-b  and  {p_i}^{k_i}\\mid n  for each of  i=1,2,...,m , we immediately have  {p_i}^{k_i}\\mid a-b . This proves that the original congruence implies the system of congruences.        For the converse, suppose  {p_i}^{k_i}\\mid a-b  for each of  i=1,2,...,m . That is, we assume the system of congruences holds. Using  this theorem , since the prime powers are coprime, you can show inductively that the whole product divides  a-b . That is,  \\prod_{i=1}^{m}{p_i}^{k_i}\\mid a-b.  But the product is just equal to  n . So  n\\mid a-b . This proves that the system of congruences implies the original congruence.      We now simplify each of the congruences. It is easy to see that  3^{999^{100}}  is a multiple of  9 . Since  \\phi(9)=6 , and that  960  is a multiple of  6 , we have  7^{960^{961}}\\equiv 7^{6n}\\equiv 1\\pmod {9} , where  n=\\frac{960^{961}}{6}  is a positive integer.    For the second congruence, observe that  \\phi(25)=20 , and  999^{100}\\equiv (-1)^{100}\\equiv 1\\pmod{20} , so  999^{100}-1=20m , where  m=\\frac{999^{100}-1}{20}  is a positive integer. Then  3^{999^{100}}\\equiv 3^{20m+1}\\equiv 3\\pmod{25} .  960  is a multiple of  20 . So  7^{960^{961}}\\equiv 7^{20k}\\equiv 1 \\pmod{25} , where  k=\\frac{960^{961}}{20} . We have arrived at the system  \\begin{cases}a\\equiv 1\\pmod {9}\\\\\\\\a\\equiv 4\\pmod {25}\\end{cases}.  You can solve this by Chinese Remainder Theorem.  "

This class of groups is axiomatized by universally quantified first-order sentences. The sentences needed are (i) some universally quantified sentences axiomatizing the class of abelian groups, together with (ii) for each $n$, a sentence  \\sigma_n  that says,  for all  x, y , if  x  and  y  both have expo n ent $n$, then  x  is a power of  y  or  y  is a power of  x .

We will prove (prove d  in two ways below) that for any  d egree $d$, there is a unique polynomial of degree $d$ satisfying this constraint, and that this polynomial is  f_d(x) = x\\left(x+\\frac{n}d\\right)\\left(x+\\frac{2n}d\\right) \\cdots \\left(x+\\frac{(d-1)n}d\\right)    Observe that  \\begin{align} f_d\\left(x+\\frac{n}{d}\\right)  &= \\left(x+\\frac{n}{d}\\right)\\left(x+\\frac{2n}{d}\\right)\\dots\\left(x+\\frac{dn}{d}\\right)\\\\ &= f_d(x)\\frac{(x+n)}{x} \\end{align}  and so with  a = n/d , we have  x(f(x+a)-f(x)) = nf(x) .    Now, if we want  integer  coefficients, note that each polynomial  f_d(x)  has integer coefficients if an d  o n ly if $d$ divides  n . So for a given $n$, the number of polynomials satisfying the constraint is the number of  d ivisors $d$ of  n , as we wanted to prove.       Proofs that  f_d(x)  is the unique polynomial of  d egree $d$ satis f ying the constraints: I see two approaches, an d  probably there may exist other better ones.    First proof.  Suppose $f$ is of degree $d$, say  f(x) = x^d + c_{d-1}x^{d-1} + \\dots + c_1x + c_0 . Then, let us compare coefficients of  x^d, x^{d-1}, \\dots  in  x(f(x+a) - f(x))  and in  nf(x) , and use the fact that they must be equal. We can either      expand all terms of  f(x+a)  using the binomial theorem, or    use  f(x+a) = f(x) + a f'(x) + \\frac{a^2}{2!}f''(x) + \\dots .       Either way, the coefficient of  x^d  in  x(f(x+a)-f(x))  is  ad , and in  nf(x)  is  n , and so  a = n/d .    Next, comparing coefficients of  x^{d-1}  gives  c_{d-1}(d-1)a + \\frac{d(d-1)}{2}a^2 = nc_{d-1} , determining  c_{d-1} . Similarly, comparing coeficients of other powers gives successively  c_{d-2}, \\dots , each got in terms of the earlier coefficients. Thus, as all coefficients  c_k  are  d etermined, there can be at most one polynomial of degree $d$ satisfying the constraint. As we have found and verified  f_d(x)  above, it must be the unique one.    Second proof.  As  x  divides the left-hand side of the given equation  x(f(x+a)-f(x)) = nf(x) , we conclude that it must divide the right-hand side, and therefore  f(x)  is a multiple of  x .    Plugging  f(x) = xg(x)  into the equation and cancelling  x , we get  (x+a)g(x+a) = (x+n)g(x) . So either  a = n  (in which case the periodicity  g(x+a)=g(x)  implies that  g  is the constant polynomial  g(x) \\equiv 1  and so  f(x) \\equiv x ), or else  (x+a)  divides  g(x) .    Plugging  g(x) = (x+a)h(x)  into the equation  (x+a)g(x+a) = (x+n)g(x)  and cancelling the  (x+a)  factor gives  (x+2a)h(x+a) = (x+n)h(x) . So either  n = 2a  (in which case  h(x) \\equiv 1 , and  f(x) \\equiv x(x+a) ) or else  (x+2a)  divides  h(x) .    Proceeding this way, we get that our polynomial is  f(x) = x(x+a)(x+2a)\\cdots(x+(d-1)a)  for some  d  such that  n = da .  "

We have, in summary, $\\phi(r) = \\phi(0) $ $\\lt$ $\\phi(a)$.    That the norm of an invertible element (unit) is the same as the norm of $1$ in an Euclidian ring (domain):    Call the Euclidian ring $E$. Let the norm be $\\phi$, let $a$ be invertible in $E$. Then for every element $\\qquad$ $\\,$ $b$ $\\neq$ $0$ $\\in$ $E$, $\\phi(a)$  \\leq   \\phi (b) , since  a unit divides every element in any ring with  1 . Especially,  \\phi (a)   \\leq   \\phi(1) . But  1  is also a unit [ 1\\ast1   =   1 ], so   \\phi(1)   \\leq   \\phi(a) . Therefore,  \\phi(a)  =  \\phi(1)  , since two numbers can't both be greater than the other number.    Constant norm in a field:    In a field you could define the norm to be  1  for each element except  0 , since every nonzero element in a field is a unit and therefore each one of them divides each other. By defining the norm of  0  to be the number zero, you are assured of having a remainder with norm less than the norm of the element you \"divide\" with. Of  c ourse, you can let the norm of all the nonzero elements of the field be any constant $c$, as long as the norm of  0  is less than this constant.    Local PIDs are euclidean    Before I go through a proof of this result, there are some things I will assume you know, and if you don't know these things, I expect you to look them up.    First of all, for a commutative ring  R  with unity, every ideal in  R  not equal to  R  is contained in a maximal ideal. This is a consequence of  Zorn's lemma . This in turn, means that every non-unit is contained in a maximal ideal, because the ideal generated by this non-unit is unequal to  R ; otherwise the non-unit would divide  1 . An element not contained in any maximal ideal must therefore be a unit.    I expect you to know what an  R -module is, what it means for it to be finitely generated, and most importantly, this;    Nakayama's lemma:  If  M  is a finitely generated  R -module, and  A  is an ideal contained in the Jacobson-radical  \\Bbb J  of  R , then  AM = M \\implies M=0 . [The Jacobson-radical of  R  is the intersection of all the maximal ideals in  R ].    Now for the good stuff:    A local PID is a PID with only one maximal ideal. Therefore, its Jacobson-radical is equal to this one ideal.     The fact that a field is a local PID I suspect you can deduce.  \\{0\\}  is the maximal ideal and its generator is  0 .    I already provided a norm on fields. To show condition (2), let  a,b \\in R  ( R  a field),  a \\neq 0 .  b = a(a^{-1}b) + 0 . Now,  \\phi(a) = 1, \\phi(0) = 0 , so   \\phi(0) \\lt \\phi(a) .    Let  R  be a local PID. Let  pR  be the only maximal ideal in  R . For  a \\neq 0 , define  \\phi:R \\to \\Bbb N  by  \\phi(a) =n  where  n  is the first  n  such that  a \\notin p^nR , and let  \\phi(0) = 0 .    Are you missing something? No. We will have to prove that such an n exists for each nonzero element in  R .    Let  M =\\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty}p^nR . This is the intersection of all ideals  p^nR , where  n \\in \\Bbb N . Now,  pM \\subseteq M , because  M  is an ideal, and  M \\subseteq pM , because  pM =\\bigcap_{n=2}^{\\infty}p^nR \\supseteq \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty}p^nR .    In effect,  pM = M , which means that  (pR)M = M , since  RM = M , since  1 \\in R . But  M  is finitely generated, because every ideal in a PID is finitely generated (of the form  cR ). Because the ideal  M  can be viewed as a module, and  pR  is the Jacobson-radical, and therefore contained in itself, we have by Nakayama that  M = 0 .    What do we do with this? Well,  M = 0  means that only  0  is in every ideal of the form  p^nR . So if  a \\neq 0 , then  a  can't be in  p^nR  for all  n . There must be a least such n by the  well-ordering principle . We have confirmed that  \\phi  is well-defined.    Do we h a ve an Euclidean norm though? Let $a$ be a unit. Then  a \\notin pR , so  \\phi(a) = 1 , and for  b \\neq 0  we clearly have  \\phi(b) \\geq \\phi(a) .    Anyway, let  a \\neq 0, b \\neq 0 . Further, let  \\phi(a) = m+1 , and let  \\phi(b) = n+1 . Then  a = p^mr  for  m \\in \\Bbb N  (or  m = 0 )and  r \\in R . We have  b= p^ns  for  n \\in \\Bbb N  (or  n = 0 ) and  s \\in R . Let  p^0  mean  1 .    a \\mid b  means  p^mr \\mid p^ns . Then  m \\gt n  gives us  p^{m-n}r \\mid s   \\implies   b = p^np^{m-n}rk  for some  k \\in R , which is basically saying that  b = p^mrk ,  b ut $b$ can't be in  p^mR , because  p^mR \\subseteq p^{n+1}R . Therefore,  \\phi(a) \\leq \\phi(b)    Property (2): Let  a, b \\in R, a \\neq 0 . Let  \\phi(a) = n . We have  a = p^{n-1}u , where  u  is a  u nit. If $u$ wasn't, it would have to be in pR [in a local ring, every element outside the maximal ideal is a unit], say  u = pr , and we get  a = p^{n-1}pr = p^nr ; a contradiction.    So now, if  \\phi(b) \\lt n , consider  b = a\\cdot0 + b . This is in accordance with (2). If  \\phi(b) \\geq n , then  b = p^mx  for some  x  in  R  and  m \\in \\Bbb N \\cup 0 , where  m \\geq n-1 , which means that  b  is also of the form  p^{n-1}y . We see that  b = au^{-1}y + 0 = p^{n-1}u \\cdot u^{-1}y = p^{n-1}y = b .    Of course,  \\phi(0) \\lt \\phi(a)  when  a \\neq 0 .    It seems to me that property (2) is the only thing that requires there to be only one maximal ideal. The maximal ideal in a field is the  0 -ideal, generated by  0 , that is, let  p=0  and write  0 = 0 \\cdot R . Now, any nonzero elements are not in this ideal, so their norm would all be  1 .  "

        "body": "From the edit:        And can it be generalized to prove that these sorts of things are fields?      The \"magic\" that is going on to compute inverses is actually not necessary to prove these things are fields, i.e. that when complex numbers  x_1,x_2,\\cdots, x_m  are roots of (rational coefficient) polynomials then the ring  \\mathbb{Q}[x_1,\\cdots,x_m]  (the set of all polynomial expressions in  x_1,\\cdots,x_m  with coefficients from  \\mathbb{Q} ) is a closed under the operations of not just addition and multiplication but division as well. Firstly, one can induct, since we can write  \\mathbb{Q}[x_1,\\cdots,x_m]=\\mathbb{Q}[x_1,\\cdots,x_{m-1}][x_m] . That is, we must show that when  K  is some field comprised of comple x  numbers and $x$ is an algebraic number, then  K[x]  is also a field. To do this, we just need some linear algebra.    Use the fact that  x  is a root of a polynomial to determine that  K[x]  is a finite-dimensional vector space over  K . Observe there are no zero divisors, i.e. the zero product property  ab=0\\Rightarrow a=0  or  b=0  holds. Then pick any nonzero element  a\\in K[x] , and consider the function  f(x)=ax  which is \"multiplic a tion-by-$a$.\" This is a linear map, and by the zero product property its kernel is trivial, hence it is a bijection (as  K[x]  is finite-dimensional), which means there exists a  b  for which  f(b)=1 , i.e.  ab=1 . This shows all nonzero elements are invertible in  K[x] .    From the comments:        So in order to apply that to the others, I guess I would need to know the conjugate of some arbitrary  a + b\\sqrt[3]{q} + c\\sqrt[3]{q}^2 ?      Indeed, computing inverses in such conte x ts amounts to \"rationalizing the denominator,\" which itself involves computing conjugates. However when our algebraic numbers are roots of polynomials beyond degree two, there will be more than one conjugate! What is a conjugate of an algebraic number anyway?    If  x  is the root of some polynomial, then there is a unique monic polynomial of minimal degree having  x  as a root, and this is termed the  minimal  polynomial of  x . The conjugates of  x  are precisely the other roots of this minimal polynomial. The  norm  of $x$ will be the product of all these conjugates, which will be rational since it is plus or minus the constant coefficient of the minimal polynomial. Thus, to compute  1/x , simply multiply the top and bottom by all of  x 's conjugates.    (To be clear: I am speaking of  x  algebraic over  \\mathbb{Q} , and the norm in the relative extension  \\mathbb{Q}(x)/\\mathbb{Q} .)    This broaches the subject of  Galois theory . A  number field  is (essentially) any collection of complex numbers which is closed under the usual arithmetic operations ( +,-,\\times,/ ) and is a finite-dimensional vector space over the rationals  \\mathbb{Q} . For example, you've seen  K=\\mathbb{Q}+\\mathbb{Q}\\sqrt{2}  is such a number field.    A  symmetry  of a number field (relative to  \\mathbb{Q}  anyway) is a relabelling of its elements, i.e. a function  f:K\\to K , which preserves the truth of all equations upon relabelling. For example, the \"conjugation\" map  a+b\\sqrt{2}\\mapsto a-b\\sqrt{2}  is a relabelling of the elements of  \\mathbb{Q}+\\mathbb{Q}\\sqrt{2}  (treat  a+b\\sqrt{2}  as a single number), and this relabelling turns the true equation  (1+\\sqrt{2})^2=3+2\\sqrt{2}  into  (1-\\sqrt{2})^2=3-2\\sqrt{2} , which is another true equation. Since all our equations are essentially polynomial expressions built from the arithmetic operations, it suffices to check such a function preserves the arithmetic operations, i.e. that it satisfies the two properties  f(a+b)=f(a)+f(b)  and  f(ab)=f(a)f(b) .    The symmetry group of a number field is its  Galois group   \\mathrm{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})  defined by    \\mathrm{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})=\\left\\{f:K\\to K~\\mathrm{such~that}~ \\begin{array}{c} f(a+b)=f(a)+f(b) \\\\ f(ab)=f(a)f(b) \\end{array}~\\mathrm{for~all~}a,b\\in K\\right\\}.     (I am avoiding discussing the important caveat that some extensions are not \"Galois,\" i.e. the number of symmetries is less than it what it's supposed to be, which is the dimension of  K  as a vector space over  \\mathbb{Q} .)    If  K=\\mathbb{Q}(x)  and  \\mathrm{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})=\\{\\sigma_1,\\cdots,\\sigma_n\\}  then the symmetries  \\sigma_i  shuffle the roots of polynomials, hence they restrict to permutations on  x 's conjugates, and in particular the set of conjugates is precisely the \"orbit\"  \\{\\sigma_1(x),\\cdots,\\sigma_n(x)\\} !    Determining what the symmetries in a Galois group are is in general a very difficult problem. Sometimes you need a number system a little bigger than  \\mathbb{Q}(x)  in order to get all of  x 's conjugates (the \"Galois closure\"). For instance, there are no nontrivial symmetries of  \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2})\\subset\\mathbb{R} , but if you allow a complex number into the mix (a cube root of unity  \\omega=\\cos(2\\pi/3)+i\\sin(2\\pi/3) ), then the conjugates of  \\sqrt[3]{2}  are  \\omega\\sqrt[3]{2}  and  \\omega^2\\sqrt[3]{2} , and more generally the conjugates of  a+b\\sqrt[3]{2}+c\\sqrt[3]{4}  are     a+b\\sqrt[3]{2}+c\\sqrt[3]{4}, \\quad a+b\\omega\\sqrt[3]{2}+c\\omega^2\\sqrt[3]{4}, \\quad a+b\\omega^2\\sqrt[3]{2}+c\\omega\\sqrt[3]{4}.

The exact number will be  \\pi(n+x)-\\pi(n) , where  \\pi(y)=\\sum_{p\\leq y}1   is the  n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime-counting_function\">prime counting function , but how large do we expect this to be?    The primes are distributed around $n$ with density  \\frac{1}{\\log n} , so the expected number would be between  \\frac{x}{\\log n}  and  \\frac{x}{\\log (n+x)} .  Provided that  n  is much larger than  x , this gives  \\frac{x}{\\log n}  as the expected number of prime years.  Supposing that a man born in  2000  lives to the ripe old age of  100 , this estimate gives approximately  13  primes in their lifetime.  In reality there are  14  primes between  2000  and  2100 , which is  n ot far off.    Note however, that if we take $n$ to be very large, it is possible that a person may live to  100  and never experience a prime year.  Indeed, suppose that an individual was born in the year  K=101!+1 . Then even if they live a long life, and die at  100  years old, they will  never have experienced a prime year, since each of  101!+2 ,  101!+3 ,  101!+4 ,..., 101!+101  are composite.    In the opposite direction, the  Brun-Titchmarsh theorem  tells us that  \\pi(x+n)-\\pi(n)\\leq \\frac{2x}{\\log x},  which gives us an upper bound on the number of prime years one can experience.  Even if one were to live to be  200  years old, they would not see more than  75  primes, regardless of when they were born.        Added:   The density of the primes, which is  \\frac{1}{\\log n}  arou n d $n$, goes to zero as  n\\rightarrow\\infty , so unless life expectancy increases over time, the expected number of primes experienced in the average lifetime will converge to zero.  A person born around the year  1  million A.D. would expect to see only 7 primes if she were to live to  100 .  To achieve the same expected number of primes as a woman born near the year  2000 , she would have to live to  190 .          This can also be used to give a good idea of how slowly  \\log x  grows.  For an individual's expected number of primes to be less than  1  in their lifetime, they would have to be born past the year  10^{44}  A.D., and considering that best estimates put the death of the sun at around  4\\times 10^9  A.D., this is very far away.        In fact, for the next  368000  years, every individual who lives to be  100  will experience at least one prime year.  However, there is  no prime over a  114  year period  from  370261  A.D. to  370365  A.D., so for the unfortunate individual born in  370261  A.D., they will experience no prime years unless they live past 114 years old.

Similarly - when the function is decreasing, its derivative will be negative.    The diagram you posted has dotted lines drawn from the top curve at  inflection points , where the slope changes from positive to negative. Notice how they're drawn downwards to the middle curve (the parabola) exactly where it crosses the x-axis.    The derivative of the parabola is negative while the parabola is decreasing, and positive while increasing. That alone doesn't guarantee a straight line:    f(x) = x^4  is very \"parabola\" shaped, and from initial inspection you may expect it to be a parabola, but the derivative ends up being cubic:  f'(x) = 4x^3.

Another is of course the notion of the boundary of an $n $-manifold with boundary.

The notio n  of \"boundary\" has a more confusing history i n  algebraic topology, where the early writers (e.g. Betti) wa n ted to talk about \"cycles modulo boundar i es\" but the notions were not clear. Poincar\u00e9's famous papers on \"Analysis situs\" (starting in 1895) cleared up many things by using simplicial decompositions and the notion of $n $-chain as a formal sum of oriented $n $-simplices, so that the boundary of an $n$-simplex had a well defined meaning. This was further clarified by Eilenberg (1944) with the notion of an ordering on the vertices of a simplex, so the that the $i$'th face  \\partial_i  \\sigma  was well defined and we could then define  \\partial \\sigma = \\sum _i (-1)^i \\partial _i \\sigma  leading to  \\partial \\partial=0  .

        "body": "For what's worth, I checked two  f rench books and Rudin's PMA, and in all cases, discontinuity is only defined for a point of the domain of definition of the function. As the other answers suggest, there may be other definitions of \"discontinuity\", for points where $f$ is not defined. I would say it's relatively harmless, apart from introducing misleading terminology.       It's misleading for another reason than just terminology, I think. A function is defined to be given by a set of \"inputs\", a set of \"outputs\", and a relation such that  each  input has an output. It makes little sense to tell anything about (continuity of) a function where it's not defined, in some sense it doesn't even \"belong\" to the function.    For example,  f:x\\rightarrow 1/x  is defined on  ]-\\infty,0[\\;\\cup\\;]0,+\\infty[ . I could tell it's discontinuous at  0 . But then I could also tell it's discontinuous at  (1,2)  (where this is a point in  \\Bbb R^2 ), or discontinuous at  \\emptyset , or anything completely meaningless: any mathematical object that is not part of the set of inputs may be said to be a point of discontinuity, but you learn nothing.    Notice that you can also define a function  g:]1,2[\\rightarrow \\Bbb R  such that  g(x)=1/x . Then  f  and  g  are  not  the same function, even though they are given by the same formula. And even  h:]1,2[\\rightarrow \\Bbb ]1/2,1[  such that  h(x)=1/x  is not the same thin g  as $g$. For example,  h  is a bijection, whereas  g  is not. Thus, the three components (input set, output set, relation) are all very important in the definition of a function.    Here,  0  has a particular status only because when we see  ]-\\infty,0[\\;\\cup\\;]0,+\\infty[ , we see also the whole real line, and this additional number  0 . But the function is just not  defined  at  0 . This conveys more useful information to say that, than to say it's discontinuous.       Whatever we may decide about discontinuity where the function is not defined, there is a good news: there won't be another definition of continuity, for one good reason. The topological definition of continuity states that, given two topological spaces  A,B ,  f:A\\rightarrow B  is continuous iff  f^{-1}(S)  is open for all open subsets  S \\subset B .    This is the  standard  definition of continuity, and is equivalent in the real case with the definition which implies that  x\\rightarrow 1/x  is continuous. For example, for  a>0 ,   f^{-1}(]-\\infty,-a[ \\;\\cup\\; ]a,+\\infty[)=]-1/a,0[\\;\\cup\\;]0,1/a[  which is an open set.       Hence, I would say that these books I checked do the right thing: where the function is defined, we can argue about continuity or discontinuity. Where it's not defined, it's meaningless.  "

Thus one sees immediately by investigating the cohomology that the induced map on  H^1  is not surjective, and in particular there are many homomorphisms that cannot be realized.     Suppose the map has nonzero degree; make it transverse to the connected sum sphere. Write  T^3 = M_1 \\cup M_2 , where  M_i   i s the inverse image of the $i$th component of the connected sum; the boundary  \\partial M_1 = \\partial M_2 = f^{-1}(S^2) .

So we've arrived at a contradiction to the original claim, and thus every map  T^3 \\to T^3 \\# T^3  is degree zero.    This argument is not particularly special to  T^3 ; you should be able to mimic it to get many more examples.

        "body": "It seems very likely that the answer is \"arbitrarily many\", at least if we are allowed to make  k_0  arbitrarily large. p >  < p >I was thinking about this question myself the other day, and I happened upon the exact same tuple mentioned on Wikipedia.  My reasoning was as follows.  Fix a prime $p$ such that every residue class modulo $p$ is represented in our (hypothetical) tuple  \\mathcal H .  Then every translate of  \\mathcal H  consisting of  p rimes must include $p$ itself.  Suppose (for example) that  (p, p + h_1, \\dots, p + h_{k_0})  and  (p - h_1, p, p - h_1 + h_2, \\dots, p - h_1 + h_{k_0})  consist entirely of  p rimes.  Then $p$ lies in the middle of three-term arithmetic progression of primes with common difference  h_1 .  Once we've found such a prime (say  p = 5 , with  h_1 = 2 ), we just need to find primes  p + h_2, \\dots, p + h_{k_0} , covering all remaining residue classes modulo  p , such that each  p + h_i - h_1  is prime.  At least in the given case, this is easy to do:   (3, 5, 11, 17, 29)  and  (5, 7, 13, 19, 31)  consist entirely of  p rimes. p >   The discussio n  above generalizes pretty easily to give more than two translates.  The natural thing to try is to find some $p$ lying in the middle of a five-term arithmetic progression (I chose 17, using the AP 5, 11, 17, 23, 29), and find three-term AP's with the same common difference covering all remaining residue classes modulo $p$.  An example is \\begin{align} \\mathcal H = (0, 2, 6, 12, 26, 42, 56, 91, 96, 146, 222, 252, 582, 642, 1086, 1176, 2702), \\end{align} which has three translates consisting of primes: \\begin{align} & (5, 7, 11, 17, 31, 47, 61, 97, 101, 151, 227, 257, 587, 647, 1091, 1181, 2707), \\\\ & (11, 13, 17, 23, 37, 53, 67, 103, 107, 157, 233, 263, 593, 653, 1097, 1187, 2713), \\\\ & (17, 19, 23, 29, 43, 59, 73, 109, 113, 163, 239, 269, 599, 659, 1103, 1193, 2719). \\end{align}    More generally, if you want $n$ prime translates, you could start with a  (2n-1) -term AP of  p rimes (which exists by Gree n -Tao), let  p  be the  n th of them, a n d try to fill in the remaining residue classes modulo  p  with primes in $n$-term APs, as above.  I don't know the current state of research well enough to say for sure whether these $n$-term APs with prescribed common difference and residue classes modulo $p$ will necessarily exist, but it seems likely that they will.    As an aside, it isn't necessary to begin with such a long arithmetic progression.  For example, if  n = 4 , you could begin with a two-dimensional AP of primes such as \\begin{matrix} 5 & 17 & 29 \\\\ 47 & 59 & 71 \\\\ 89 & 101 & 113, \\end{matrix} take  p = 59 , and construct your four translates so that each one contains one of the four 2x2 corners of the grid above.

W.L.O.G we consider the case that  m  lies in the segment  y-x , i.e. the segment joints  x  and  y .    We will have three cases.    Case  1 :  Both  x  and  y  are orthogonal to  z .    We just choose a vector  q_1  in the direction of  x  and lies in the ball  K . Let  q=m+q_1 , then  q=tx+(1-t)y+\\delta x=(t+\\delta)x+(1-t)y , where  t\\in [0,1]   and   0\\lt \\delta \\lt r . Since  t+\\delta+1-t=\\delta+1\\gt1 , so  q\\in A^c .    Case  2 :  only one of  x  and  y  are orthogonal to  z .    W.L.O.G we assume  x  are orthogonal to  z .    We just choose a vector  q_1  in the direction of  x  and lies in the ball  K . Let  q=q_1+m . Similar to case  1 , we can prove  q\\in A^c .    Case 3:  None of  x  and  y  are orthogonal to  z .(Note that it cannot happen that both  x  and  y  are parallel to  z , it will contradicts the assumption that  x-y  and  x-z  are li n ear independent.)    Let $n$ be a vector which is orthogonal to  z . Clearly,  n  ca n  have two choices of direction. We choose $n$ in the direction s.t.  n\\cdot x\\gt 0 . We choose the vector  q_1  i n  the direction of $n$ and lies in the ball  K . Let  q=q_1+m . Similar to case  1 , we can prove  q\\in A^c . p >   Now we deal with the existence of $p$.    In fact, we just reverse the direction of the vector  q_1  in above cases. And let  p=q_1+m , then it will lies in  A , which can be shown as above.    QED.  "

Definition:  A  set $A$ is called well-ordered if there exists a total   ordering  \\leq_*  on  A  such that  any  subset  B \\subseteq A  has   a minimum element with respect to  \\leq_* .      Now what does mathematical induction says?    It says that suppose I have a set of statements  P(n)  for each  n \\in \\mathbb{N}  and I know that  P(1)  is true. If  P(n) \\implies P(n+1)  then  P(n)  is true for any natural number  n \\in \\mathbb{N} .     So, what you have proved is that any finite set of the form  \\{1,2,\\cdots,k\\}  is well-ordered. Of course, there are many subsets in  \\mathbb{N}  that are not necessarily of this form. But let's ignore this issue for now because it can be fixed easily.    Let's say that we have proved  P(k)=\\{ \\text{a set of size k is well-ordered}\\}  is true by mathematical induction using your method. Can we conclude that a set of infinite cardinality is well-ordered? No! Because infinity is not a natural number. So, you still need to prove that sets of infinite cardinality in  \\mathbb{N}  are well-ordered to have demonstrated that \" any subset  of  \\mathbb{N} \" has a minimum element.    Here's a proof:    Claim I:  Any non-empty subset of natural numbers with finite cardinality is well-ordered.    Proof:  we will use mathematical induction on the size of subsets  \\emptyset \\neq A \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}  where  |A| < \\infty .     If  n=1 , then we have only one element in the set and it is trivial. If  |A|=n+1 , consider  B \\subset A  which is obtained by removing only one element from  A , i.e.  B \\cup \\{a\\}=A . Since  |B|=n , it has a minimum element  b_0 . Now choose  a_0 = \\min\\{a,b_0\\} . Q.E.D    Claim II:  Any non-empty subset of natural numbers, even with infinite cardinality is well-ordered.    Proof:  the idea of the proof for this part was first posted by William Elliot. Take  \\emptyset \\neq A \\subseteq \\mathbb{N} . Since  A  is non-empty, there exists some natural number  m \\in A . Consider  B=\\{n \\in A: n \\leq m\\} .  B  has at  m ost $m$ elements and therefore is finite and has a minimum:  b_0 . Now notice that  A = B \\cup B^c  where  B^c  is the complement of  B , i.e.  B^c = \\{ n \\in A: n > m \\} .     Now,  b_0  is also the minimum of  A  bec a use any element $a$ in  A  is either in  B  or  B^c . If  a  is in  B , then  b_0 \\leq a . If  a  is in  B^c , then  a > m  and  b_0 \\leq m  and again we see that  b_0 \\leq a . Q.E.D.  "

So the problem is to define two sigma algebras, a stochastic variable,   specify a probabilty measure on the sample space  \\Omega  and show   that the following relation doesn't equal:        E[E[X|\\mathcal{G}]|\\mathcal{F}]\\neq E[E[X|\\mathcal{F}]|\\mathcal{G}]        So I started by defining the sigma algebras:        \\Omega=\\{a,b,c\\}   \\mathcal{F}=\\{\\emptyset,\\Omega,a,(b,c)\\}     \\mathcal{G}=\\{\\emptyset,\\Omega,b,(a,c)\\}  With the stochastic   variable  X :  X(a)=0,X(b)=1,X(c)=2  Probability measures.

Thus I end up with:    E[1_b+1_{a\\cup c}|\\mathcal{F}]   E[\\frac{3}{2}1_{b \\cup c}|\\mathcal{G}]    The expected value of a constant, no matter what sigma algebra it's conditioned with ends up being a constant.    E[\\frac{3}{2}1_{b \\cup c}|\\mathcal{G}]=\\frac{3}{2}E[1_{b \\cup c}|\\mathcal(G)]    And as the events  b  and  a\\cup c  are disjoint one should be able to seperate them.    E[1_b+1_{a\\cup c}|\\mathcal{F}]=E[1_b|\\mathcal{F}]+E[1_{a\\cup c}|\\mathcal{F}]    The expectation of a indicator function is just the probability of the expected value.    The union between  a\\cup c  isn't included in the  \\mathcal{F}  and  b \\cup c  isn't included in  \\mathcal{G} , I guess one says that it isn't  \\mathcal{F} -measurable and  \\mathcal{G} -measurable respectively?. Thus I assume that one ends up with:    E[1_b+1_{a\\cup c}|\\mathcal{F}]=\\frac{P(b)}{P(b)+P(C)}+0   E[1_b+1_{a\\cup c}|\\mathcal{F}]=\\frac{1}{2}   \\frac{3}{2}E[1_{b \\cup c}|\\mathcal(G)]=0    Thus:    E[E[X|\\mathcal{G}]|\\mathcal{F}]=\\frac{1}{2}   E[E[X|\\mathcal{F}]|\\mathcal{G}]=0    So we get:    \\frac{1}{2}\\neq 0    Hopefully I haven't messed up.    EDIT:    If I remember correctly the union of an event  A  and  B  is defined as the event  A  or  B  happening or both happening. I also looked up what the indicator function of a union is and got:    1_{A\\cup B}=1_A+1_B-1_A1_B    Substituting the indicatior of the unions I get:     \\frac{3}{2}E[1_{b \\cup c}|\\mathcal{G}]=\\frac{3}{2}(E[1_b+1_c-1_b1_c|b]1_b+E[1_b+1_c-1_b1_c|a\\cup c]1_{a \\cup c})    Which then gives:    \\frac{3}{2}E[1_{b \\cup c}|\\mathcal{G}]=\\frac{3}{2}(1_b+\\frac{1}{2}1_{a \\cup c})=\\frac{3}{2}1_b+\\frac{3}{4}1_{a \\cup c}    The last step is then to evaluate:    E[1_b+1_{a \\cup c}|\\mathcal{F}]=1_a+1_{b \\cup c}    In the end:    1_a+1_{b \\cup c} \\neq \\frac{3}{2}1_b+\\frac{3}{4}1_{a \\cup c}    I assume this holds because if you look at the indicator functions they can't really equate.

So once we've esta b lished the existen c e of $b$ and $c$, it follows that  D_c(0) \\subset f(\\mathbb{D})  for all  f\\in \\mathbb{F} .    To show the existence of  b  and  c , we use the normality of  \\mathbb{F} . Since enlarging  \\mathbb{F}  makes the proposition stronger, we assume that  \\mathbb{F} = \\left\\{ f\\in \\mathscr{O}(\\mathbb{D}) : f(0) = 0, f'(0) = 1, \\lvert f(z)\\rvert < 5 \\text{ for all } z \\in \\mathbb{D}\\right\\}.

By Hurwitz's theorem, for all large e n ough $n$,  f_n  also has exactly one zero (counting mutliplicities) in  \\overline{D_\\delta(0)} , so  \\beta(f_n) > \\delta , and hence  b_0 \\geqslant \\delta > 0 .

This is an answer to the question as originally posted.    The question is whether it is true that  |\\pi(x)-\\frac{x}{\\log x}|= O(\\sqrt{x}\\log x).  It seemed you had seen this somewhere but the usual statement from Schoenfeld ^1  assuming RH is that  |\\pi(x)-Li(x)|=O(\\sqrt{x}\\log x).

Writing down the fact that  $1\\in I$  and evaluating  $X=\\alpha$  would leads us to the conclusion  $n=\\deg_Y(P)=0$ , which is absurd.      This is all I could infer so far.

When hunting for suitable  p rimes $p$ we can simply look at the factorizations of these numbers. For  p>3  to be a factor of  k^{2m}+k^m+1=(k^{3m}-1)/(k^m-1)  we see that  k^m  has to be a  p rimitive third root of unity modulo $p$. We obviously apply this to both  k=2  and  k=10 .     To get those primitive third roots of unity we need  \\ell=\\operatorname{ord}_p(2)  to be divisible by three. If  \\ell=3u  we then see that  p\\mid 4^m+2^m+1  if and only if  m\\equiv u,2u\\pmod{3u} .  But, if  t=\\operatorname{ord}_p(10)  is also divisible by three, say  t=3v , we also have that  p\\mid 100^m+10^m+1  whenever  m\\equiv v,2v\\pmod{3v} . Anyway, this allows to conclude that  m  cannot be in certain residue classes modulo  3w  where  w=\\operatorname{lcm}(u,v) . Observe  t hat if $t$ is not a multiple of three, then  100^m+10^m+1  is never divisible by  p , because  10^m  is then never a primitive third root of unity.    Getting our hands dirty we see that:      With  p=7  we have  \\ell=3  and  t=6 , both divisible by three. This means that when  m\\equiv1,5\\pmod6  we have  7\\mid 4^m+2^m+1  and  7\\nmid 100^m+10^m+1 .   With  p=73\\mid 2^9-1  we have  \\ell=9=3\\cdot3  and  t=8 . This means that  73\\mid 4^m+2^m+1  iff  m\\equiv3,6\\pmod9 . But  100^m+10^m+1  is never divisible by  73  so we have covered these values of  m . At this point we have excluded  10  out of  18  residue classes modulo  18 , so we have covered more than half the integers.   The prime  p=13  is a factor of  2^{12}-1  and  \\ell=12 . But here  t=6  is a factor of  \\ell . This is bad news for us. No values of  m  can be excluded. For if  m\\equiv4,8\\pmod{12}  then automatically  m\\equiv2,4\\pmod{6} . In these cases  13  is a common factor of both  4^m+2^m+1  and  100^m+10^m+1 . The same thing happens whenever  2  is a  p rimitive root modulo $p$. We really need to look for non-primitive cases.   With  p=151\\mid 2^{15}-1  we have  \\ell=15=3\\cdot5 . Here  t=75=3\\cdot25 . This  m eans that we can rule out $m$, if  m\\equiv5,10\\pmod{15}  and  m\\not\\equiv25,50\\pmod{75} .

When  n = 9  (the sum of digits) and  k = 10 , it is  \\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} = \\binom{9 + 10 - 1}{10 - 1} .    Let me  n ow explai n  the idea of (1) partitio n , (2) composition and ( 3 ) weak composition of a positive integer. A partition of a positive integer $n$ is a way of writing it as a sum of positive integers, where the order of the summands does not matter. If the order matters then we have a composition. A weak composition is the one in which we can use a zero as a summand. If there is no restriction on the number of summands then the number of weak compositions is infinity.    Let us now consider the number of weak compositions of a positive integer $n$. Represent $n$ as a sequence of 1s with a gap between them. Each gap can be filled with either a plus sign or a comma. A comma means \"1,1,1\" is $3$ while a plus is the usual addition. Since there are  n - 1  gaps betwee n  $n$ 1s, with each gap having a two choices, there are  2^{n-1}  compositio n s of $n$.    If we have to count the number of compositions in  k  parts, only plus signs are allowed in the gaps and that too only  k - 1  of them. A n  empty gap is interpreted as a comma in the sense of the above paragraph. Therefore, the number of compositions of $n$ into  k  parts is \\begin{equation} \\binom{n - 1}{k - 1} \\end{equation}    Now comes the trick for a weak composition. Consider a composition of the number  n + k  into  k  parts. Let it be expressed as  \\begin{equation} d_1 + d_2 + \\cdots + d_k = n + k \\end{equation} where  1 \\le d_i \\le 9  for all  i . We can write it as \\begin{equation} (d_1 - 1) + (d_2 - 1) + \\cdots + (d_k - 1) = n \\end{equation} If  e_i = d_i - 1  then \\begin{equation} e_1 + e_2 + \\cdots + e_k = n \\end{equation} where  0 \\le e_1 \\le 9 . Thus, the  n umber of wea k  compositions of $n$ of size $k$ is equal to the number of compositions of  n + k  of size  k , which is, \\begin{equation} \\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} \\end{equation}  "
